the of an object involves transmitting acoustic pulses towards the it, capture the resulting echo at various points in space using an array of apertures, and from this and general geometric knowledge derive the

 using the data recorded from each of the apertures and general knowledge of the geometry.

Furthermore, the algorithm maps well to single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs). We show that even a modest amount of optimisation work has resulted in a factor 10 speed-up of this algorithm when implemented on a GPU as opposed to on a CPU.
