@article{Buskenes2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1976-2012 IEEE. We have studied the low-complexity adaptive (LCA) beamformer in active sonar imaging. LCA can be viewed as either a simplification of the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, or as an adaptive extension to the delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer. While both LCA and MVDR attempt to minimize the power of noise and interference in the image, MVDR achieves this by computing optimal array weights from the spatial statistics of the wavefield, while LCA selects the best performing weights out of a predefined set. To build confidence in the LCA method, we show that a robust MVDR implementation typically creates weight sets with shapes spanning between a rectangular and Hamming window function. We let LCA select from a set of Kaiser windows with responses in this span, and add some steered variations of each. We limit the steering to roughly half the -3 -dB width of the window's amplitude response. Using experimental data from the Kongsberg Maritime HISAS1030 sonar we find that LCA and MVDR produce nearly identical images of large scenes, both being superior to DAS. On point targets LCA is able to double the resolution compared to DAS, or provide half that of MVDR. This performance is achieved with a total of six windows: the rectangular window and the Kaiser window with $\beta$=5, in an unsteered version, and versions that are left and right steered to the steering limit. Slightly smoother images are produced if the window count is increased to 15, but past this we observe minimal difference. Finally, we show that LCA works just as well if Kaiser windows are substituted with trigonometric ones. All our observations and experiences point to LCA being very easy to understand and manage. It simply works, and is surprisingly insensitive to the exact type of window function, steering amount, or number of windows. It can be efficiently implemented on parallel hardware, and handles any scene without the need for parameter adjustments.},

abstract = {Rapid advancements in adaptive sonar beamforming algorithms have greatly increased the computation and communication demands on beamforming arrays, particularly for applications that require in-array autonomous operation. By coupling each transducer node in a distributed array with a microprocessor, and networking them together, embedded parallel processing for adaptive beamformers can significantly reduce execution time, power consumption and cost, and increase scalability and dependability. In this paper, the basic narrowband Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamformer is enhanced by incorporating broadband processing, a technique to enhance the robustness of the algorithm, and speedup of the matrix inversion task using sequential regression. Using this Robust Broadband MVDR (RB-MVDR) algorithm as a sequential baseline, two novel parallel algorithms are developed and analyzed. Performance results are included, among them execution time, scaled speedup, parallel efficiency, result latency and memory utilization. The testbed used is a distributed system comprised of a cluster of personal computers connected by a conventional network.},

Each beamforming method was divided into two kernels consisting of various beamforming and mid-processing blocks and efficiently implemented on a NVIDIA's Computer Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform (GeForce GTX560 Ti, NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To evaluate the performance of each method, pre-beamformed radio-frequency (RF) data were captured by a commercial ultrasound machine equipped with a research package (G40, Siemens Healthcare, Mountain View, CA, USA) from a tissue mimicking phantom. The execution time for each beamforming algorithm was measured by using a time stamp produced by a CUDA timer. The IBF-PRE outperforms over other methods (i.e., IBF-POST, PRBF-PRE, PRBF-POST), in terms of execution time, i.e., 7.89 ms vs. 16.19 ms, 21.89 ms, and 10.62 ms, respectively. This result indicates that the IBF-PRE method is suitable for the fully software based ultrasound imaging system. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {If an ultrasound imaging system provides a presentation of a moving object which is sensitive to small spatial shifts, the system is said to be locally spatially shift-variant. This can happen, for instance, if the axial or lateral sampling is insufficient. The Capon beamformer has been shown to provide increased lateral resolution in ultrasound images. Increased lateral resolution should demand denser lateral sampling. However, in previous literature on Capon beamforming for medical ultrasound imaging, only single-frame scenarios have been simulated. Temporal behavior and effects caused by the increased resolution and lack of oversampling have therefore been neglected. In this paper, we analyze the local lateral shift-invariance of the Capon beamformer when imaging moving objects. We show that insufficient lateral sampling makes an imaging system based on the Capon beamformer laterally shift-variant. Different methods for oversampling on transmit and receive are then discussed and investigated to improve on the Capon beamformer. It is shown that lateral shift-invariance can be improved by oversampling based on phase rotation on receive without affecting the acquisition frame rate and with a minor change in processing complexity.},

abstract = {Applying the Capon adaptive beamformer in medical ultrasound imaging results in enhanced resolution by improving the interference-suppressing capabilities of the array. This improvement comes at the expense of an increased computational complexity. We have investigated the application of a beamspace adaptive beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging, which can be used to achieve reduced computational complexity with performance comparable to that of the Capon beamformer. The idea behind beamspace beamforming is that, instead of using the spatial statistics of the elements in the array to differentiate between signals and interference, we use the spatial statistics of a set of orthogonal beams, which are formed in different directions. This represents a shift from element space to beamspace. Because the majority of interference in medical ultrasound imaging is constrained to a limited spatial interval due to the focused transmit beam, this latter space can be reduced to a dimension that is lower than that of element space. We show, using simulations and experimental data, that this dimension can be selected as low as 3 while still achieving performance comparable to its element space counterpart.},

@article{Hergum2007,
abstract = {Parallel beamforming is frequently used to increase the acquisition rate of medical ultrasound imaging. However, such imaging systems will not be spatially shift invariant due to significant variation across adjacent beams. This paper investigates a few methods of parallel beamforming that aims at eliminating this flaw and restoring the shift invariance property. The beam-to-beam variations occur because the transmit and receive beams are not aligned. The underlying idea of the main method presented here is to generate additional synthetic transmit beams (STB) through interpolation of the received, unfocused signal at each array element prior to beamforming. Now each of the parallel receive beams can be aligned perfectly with a transmit beam - synthetic or real - thus eliminating the distortion caused by misalignment. The proposed method was compared to the other compensation methods through a simulation study based on the ultrasound simulation software Field II. The results have been verified with in vitro experiments. The simulations were done with parameters similar to a standard cardiac examination with two parallel receive beams and a transmit-line spacing corresponding to the Rayleigh criterion, wavelength times f-number ($\lambda$ {\textperiodcentered} f {\#}). From the results presented, it is clear that straightforward parallel beamforming reduces the spatial shift invariance property of an ultrasound imaging system. The proposed method of using synthetic transmit beams seems to restore this important property, enabling higher acquisition rates without loss of image quality. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent work on Capon beamforming suggest that it can provide increased lateral resolution when applied in a medical ultrasound imaging setting. In this paper, the high computational complexity of the Capon beamformer is targeted with the use of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In-vivo results with Capon beamforming applied on a full cardiac cycle in addition to simulations are presented. With the GPU we are able to process a 70°sector cardiac image from a 64 element phased array at interactive frame rates using both spatial and temporal smoothing. For a typical cardiac ultrasound image of 80 × 400 pixels (70°sector, 15 cm range) acquired using a 2.5 MHz, M=64 element phased array, we obtain 10 fps (subarray length L=M/2, temporal smoothing over 3 samples). If we perform a 2-element pre-beamforming, the channel count is reduced to 32, and frame rate is increased to 44 fps. For a 32 element phased array we need less beams to cover the sector (40×400 pixels), hence with the same parameters the frame rate increases to 87 fps. The target GPU was the Nvidias Quadro 6000, capable of 1 Tflops. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Jensen2012,
abstract = {Medical ultrasound imaging systems are often based on transmitting, and recording the backscatter from, a series of focused broadband beams with overlapping coverage areas. When applying adaptive beamforming, a separate array covariance matrix for each image sample is usually formed. The data used to estimate any one of these covariance matrices is often limited to the recorded backscatter from a single transmitted beam, or that of some adjacent beams through additional focusing at reception. We propose to form, for each radial distance, a single covariance matrix covering all of the beams. The covariance matrix is estimated by combining the array samples after a sequenced time delay and phase shift. The time delay is identical to that performed in conventional delay-and-sum beamforming. The performance of the proposed approach in conjunction with the Capon beamformer is studied on both simulated data of scenes consisting of point targets and recorded ultrasound phantom data from a specially adapted commercial scanner. The results show that the proposed approach is more capable of resolving point targets and gives better defined cyst-like structures in speckle images compared with the conventional delay-and-sum approach. Furthermore, it shows both an increased robustness to noise and an increased ability to resolve point-like targets compared with the more traditional per-beam Capon beamformer. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Some success has been demonstrated in the extensive studies of adaptive imaging, but these approaches are generally not suitable for high-frame-rate (HFR) imaging where broad transmit beams are required. In this study, we propose an effective adaptive imaging method suitable for HFR imaging based on coherence-factor (CF) weighting and the minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) method. The CF is an index of focusing quality estimated from receive-channel data in which the amplitude of each image pixel is weighted by the corresponding CF so as to reduce the unwanted sidelobes. Direct implementation of CF weighting in HFR imaging does not provide satisfactory results because the broad transmit beams required for HFR imaging reduce the accuracy of CF calculations. In this study, we alleviated this problem by applying the MVDR method. We test the proposed method with the synthetic transmit aperture method where only 8 firings are required to form an image. Both simulations and clinical breast imaging data were used, and the proposed method enhanced the mean contrast by around 4.6 dB and the mean contrast-to-noise ratio by around 20{\%}. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective at improving the image quality.},

abstract = {Medical ultrasound imaging is conventionally done by insonifying the imaged medium with focused beams. The backscattered echoes are beamformed using delay-and-sum operations that cannot completely eliminate the contribution of signals backscattered by structures off the imaging beam to the beamsum. It leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. This paper presents an adaptation of the Capon beamformer algorithm to ultrasound medical imaging with focused beams. The strategy is to apply data-dependent weight functions to the imaging aperture. These weights act as lateral spatial filters that filter out off-axis signals. The weights are computed for each point in the imaged medium, from the statistical analysis of the signals backscattered by that point to the different elements of the imaging probe when insonifying it with different focused beams. Phantom and in vivo images are presented to illustrate the benefits of the Capon algorithm over the conventional delay and-sum approach. On heart sector images, the clutter in the heart chambers is decreased. The endocardium border is better defined. On abdominal linear array images, significant contrast and resolution enhancement are observed.},

abstract = {We have applied the minimum variance (MV) adaptive beamformer to medical ultrasound imaging and shown significant improvement in image quality compared to delay-and-sum (DAS). We demonstrate reduced mainlobe width and suppression of sidelobes on both simulated and experimental RF data of closely spaced wire targets, which gives potential contrast and resolution enhancement in medical images. The method is applied to experimental RF data from a heart phantom, in which we show increased resolution and improved definition of the ventricular walls. A potential weakness of adaptive beamformers is sensitivity to errors in the assumed wavefleld parameters. We look at two ways to increase robustness of the proposed method; spatial smoothing and diagonal loading. We show that both are controlled by a single parameter that can move the performance from that of a MV beamformer to that of a DAS beamformer. We evaluate the sensitivity to velocity errors and show that reliable amplitude estimates are achieved while the mainlobe width and sidelobe levels are still significantly lower than for the conventional beamformer. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

@article{Buskenes2014,
abstract = {—The minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer has recently been proposed as an attractive alternative to conventional beamformers in active sonar imaging. Unfortunately, it is very computationally complex because a spatial covariance matrix must be estimated and inverted for each image pixel. This may discourage its unnecessary use in sonar systems which are continuously being pushed to ever higher imaging ranges and resolutions. In this study, we show that for active sonar systems up to 32 channels, the computation time can be significantly reduced by performing arithmetic optimizations, and by implementing the MVDR beamformer on a graphics pro-cessing unit (GPU). We point out important hardware limitations for these devices, and assess the design in terms of how efficiently it is able to use the GPU's resources. On a quad-core Intel Xeon system with a high-end Nvidia GPU, our GPU implementation renders more than a million pixels per second (1 MP/s). Compared to our initial central processing unit (CPU) implementation, the optimizations described herein led to a speedup of more than two orders of magnitude, or an expected five to ten times improvement had the CPU received similar optimization effort. This throughput enables real-time processing of sonar data, and makes the MVDR a viable alternative to conventional methods in practical systems.},

abstract = {The paper describes a new technique for adaptive antenna beamforming. By analysing the adaptive antenna as a least-squares problem, it is possible to organise the control processor around a recursive minimisation procedure operating in the data domain. This avoids the explicit computation of the covariance matrix estimate as required by the method known as sample matrix inversion (SMI). The paper further shows how the least-squares processing algorithm may be implemented in an efficient pipeline architecture using a triangular systolic array. Computer simulation results are presented which show the performance of this new technique compared with sample matrix inversion.},

A problem of this kind emerges when one wants to infer the momentum distribution of the neutral pions by detecting the $\pi$0 decay photons using the photon spectrometer of the ALICE LHC experiment at CERN [1]. The underlying integral equation connecting the sought for pion spectrum and the measured gamma spectrum has been discretized and subsequently reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations. The latter system, however, is known to be ill-posed and must be regularized to obtain a stable solution. This task has been accomplished here by means of the Tikhonov regularization scheme combined with the L-curve method. The resulting pion spectrum is in an excellent quantitative agreement with the pion spectrum obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {COMPET is an innovative implementation of a small animal PET scanner using a novel block detector geometry, allowing for a high resolution and high sensitivity. One detector block is built up from layers of long LYSO crystals. Perpendicular and interleaved between the crystals, Wave Length Shifting (WLS) fibers are used. The scintillation light created by a gamma ray interacting with a crystal is measured with Geiger mode Avalanche Photo Diodes (GAPDs) at one end of the crystals. A small part of the scintillation light escapes the crystals and enters the WLS, where it has a certain probability to be absorbed and re-emitted at a longer wavelength. This light is measured at one end of the WLS by a GAPD. With this setup, the point of interaction (POI) of the gamma ray is deduced, allowing for the 3D reconstruction of the interaction point between the gamma ray and the detector. Thus, not only photoelectric interactions are used to reconstruct the line of responses (LOR) for each event, but also Compton scattered gamma-rays are included. Using 4 such modules, the total detector comprises a total amount of 1080 readout channels, where 600 are used for the crystals and 480 for the WLS. The central point source resolution was deduced from Monte Carlo simulation to be below 1 mm FWHM in transaxial direction. The sensitivity to detect coincident gamma rays emitted at the centre of the field of view is up to 16{\%}. With its compact geometry, high point source resolution, high sensitivity and its low amount of readout channels, the COMPET detector geometry provides a promising detector layout for future preclinical PET scanners. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The sliding DFT process for spectrum analysis was presented and shown to be more efficient than the popular Goertzel (1958) algorithm for sample-by-sample DFT bin computations. The sliding DFT provides computational advantages over the traditional DFT or FFT for many applications requiring successive output calculations, especially when only a subset of the DFT output bins are required. Methods for output stabilization as well as time-domain data windowing by means of frequency-domain convolution were also discussed. A modified sliding DFT algorithm, called the sliding Goertzel DFT, was proposed to further reduce the computational workload. We start our sliding DFT discussion by providing a review of the Goertzel algorithm and use its behavior as a yardstick to evaluate the performance of the sliding DFT technique. We examine stability issues regarding the sliding DFT implementation as well as review the process of frequency-domain convolution to accomplish time-domain windowing. Finally, a modified sliding DFT structure is proposed that provides improved computational efficiency.},

@article{Asl2012,
abstract = {In recent years, adaptive beamforming methods have been successfully applied to medical ultrasound imaging, resulting in simultaneous improvement in imaging resolution and contrast. These improvements have been achieved at the expense of higher computational complexity, with respect to the conventional non-adaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer, in which computational complexity is proportional to the number of elements, O(M). The computational overhead results from the covariance matrix inversion needed for computation of the adaptive weights, the complexity of which is cubic with the subarray size, O(L(3)). This is a computationally intensive procedure, which makes the implementation of adaptive beamformers less attractive in spite of their advantages. Considering that, in medical ultrasound applications, most of the energy is scattered from angles close to the steering angle, assuming spatial stationarity is a good approximation, allowing us to assume the Toeplitz structure for the estimated covariance matrix. Based on this idea, in this paper, we have applied the Toeplitz structure to the spatially smoothed covariance matrix by averaging the entries along all subdiagonals. Because the inverse of the resulting Toeplitz covariance matrix can be computed in O(L(2)) operations, this technique results in a greatly reduced computational complexity. By using simulated and experimental RF data-point targets as well as cyst phantoms-we show that the proposed low-complexity adaptive beamformer significantly outperforms the DAS and its performance is comparable to that of the minimum variance beamformer, with reduced computational complexity.},

The ability to beamform efficiently with reasonable power requirements is discussed in this paper. Whilst the most appropriate beamforming technology will change over time due to semiconductor and processing developments, we present a hierarchical structure which is technology agnostic and describe both Radio-Frequency (RF) and digital hierarchical beamforming approaches. We present implementations of both RF and digital beamforming systems on two antenna array demonstrators, namely the Electronic Multi Beam Radio Astronomy ConcEpt (EMBRACE) and the dualpolarisation all-digital array (2-PAD). This paper will compare and contrast both digital and analogue implementations without considering the deep system design of these arrays.},

abstract = {Shadowing of an imaging aperture occurs when ultrasound beams are partially obstructed by an acoustically hard tissue, e.g., bone tissue. This effect leads to reduced resolution and, in some cases, geometrical distortion. In this paper, we initially introduce a binary apodization model to simulate effects of the shadowing on the point scatterers located close to a bone structure. Further, in a simulation study and an in vitro experiment, the minimum variance (MV) beamforming method is employed to image scatterers partly located in the shadow of bone. We show that the MV beamformer can result in a distorted image when the imaging aperture is highly obstructed by the bone structure. This distortion can be seen as an apparent lateral shift of the point spread function and a decrease in the sensitivity. Based on the signal power across the aperture, we adaptively determine the shadowed elements and discard their corresponding data from the covariance matrix to improve the MV beamformer performance. This modified MV beamformer can retain the resolution and compensate for the apparent lateral shifting and signal attenuation for the shadowed point scatterers. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Cognitive science has developed computational models that decompose cognition into functional components. Computational neuroscience has modeled how interacting neurons can implement elementary components of cognition. It is time to assemble the pieces of the puzzle of brain computation and to better integrate these separate disciplines. Modern technologies enable us to measure and manipulate brain activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in animals and humans. However, experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test brain-computational models. Here we review recent work in the intersection of cognitive science, computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

abstract = {For over thirty years adaptive beamforming (AB) algorithms have been applied in RADAR and SONAR signal processing. Higher resolution and contrast is attainable using those algorithms at the price of an increased computational load. In this paper we consider four beamformers (BFs): Frost BF, Duvall BF, SSB, and SPOC. These algorithms are well know in the RADAR/SONAR literature. We have performed a series of simulations using ultrasound data to test the performance of those algorithms and compare them to the conventional, data independent, beamforming. Every algorithm was applied on single channel ultrasonic data that was generated using Field II. For a 32 element linear array operating at 5 MHz, beamplot results show that while the Duvall and SSB beamformers reduce sidelobes by roughly 20 dB, the sidelobes using the Frost algorithm rise by 23dB. The -6dB resolution is improved by 38{\%}, 83{\%}, and 43{\%} in the case of Duvall, Frost, and SSB algorithms, respectively. In the case of SPOC, the beamplot shows a super-resolution peak with noise floor at -110 dB. Similar results were obtained for an array consisting of 64 elements. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

In this paper, we present an implementation of the Capon beamformer that exhibits realtime performance when applied in a typical cardiac ultrasound imaging setting. To achieve this performance, we make use of the parallel processing power found in modern graphics processing units (GPUs), combined with beamspace processing to reduce the computational complexity as the number of array elements increases. For a three-dimensional beamspace, we show that processing rates supporting real-time cardiac ultrasound imaging are possible, meaning that images can be processed faster than the image acquisition rate for a wide range of parameters. Image quality is investigated in an in vivo cardiac data set. These results show that Capon beamforming is feasible for cardiac ultrasound imaging, providing images with improved lateral resolution both in element-space and beamspace.},

abstract = {Recently, significant improvement in image resolution has been demonstrated by applying adaptive beamforming to medical ultrasound imaging. In this paper, we have used the minimum-variance beamformer to show how the low sidelobe levels and narrow beamwidth of adaptive methods can be used, not only to increase resolution, but also to enhance imaging in several ways. By using a minimum-variance beamformer instead of delay-and-sum on reception, reduced aperture, higher frame rates, or increased depth of penetration can be achieved without sacrificing image quality. We demonstrate comparable resolution on images of wire targets and a cyst phantom obtained with a 96-element, 18.5-mm transducer using delay-and-sum, and a 48-element, 9.25-mm transducer using minimum variance. To increase frame rate, fewer and wider transmit beams in combination with several parallel receive beams may be used. We show comparable resolution to delay-and-sum using minimum variance, 1/4th of the number of transmit beams and 4 parallel receive beams, potentially increasing the frame rate by 4. Finally, we show that by lowering the frequency of the transmitted beam and beamforming the received data with the minimum variance beamformer, increased depth of penetration is achieved without sacrificing lateral resolution. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Minimum Variance (MV) beamforming has been studied for high resolution ultrasonic imaging. However, it is not easy for the MV beamformer to be implemented into a real time diagnostic system, because it requires too much computation time in calculating covariance matrix inversion. This paper introduces a flexible MV weight estimation that can dynamically reduce the matrix dimension using principal component transform. Principal components are estimated offline from pre-calculated conventional MV weights. It is assumed that all MV weights can be approximated by a linear combination of selected principal vectors. In this paper, flexible MV weight estimation is introduced by deriving a linearly approximated minimum variance criterion with a constraint using Lagrange multiplier. Our method does not directly calculate the MV weights but estimates the weights in the linear combination of the selected principal components. The combinational weights are a function of the inversion of a transformed covariance matrix whose dimension is identical to the number of the selected component vectors. Delay-and-sum (DAS), conventional MV, and flexible MV method were experimented on Field II simulation using point targets and cysts. Our method can reduce the dimension of the covariance matrix down to 2 × 2 while maintaining the good image quality of the minimum variance. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Haykin2006,
abstract = {This article discusses a new idea called cognitive radar. Three ingredients are basic to the constitution of cognitive radar: 1) intelligent signal processing, which builds on learning through interactions of the radar with the surrounding environment; 2) feedback from the receiver to the transmitter, which is a facilitator of intelligence; and 3) preservation of the information content of radar returns, which is realized by the Bayesian approach to target detection through tracking. All three of these ingredients feature in the echo-location system of a bat, which may be viewed as a physical realization (albeit in neurobiological terms) of cognitive radar. Radar is a remote-sensing system that is widely used for surveillance, tracking, and imaging applications, for both civilian and military needs. In this article, we focus on future possibilities of radar with particular emphasis on the issue of cognition. As an illustrative case study along the way, we consider the problem of radar surveillance applied to an ocean environment.},

@article{Buskenes2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1976-2012 IEEE. The minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer has recently been proposed as an attractive alternative to conventional beamformers in active sonar imaging. Unfortunately, it is very computationally complex because a spatial covariance matrix must be estimated and inverted for each image pixel. This may discourage its unnecessary use in sonar systems which are continuously being pushed to ever higher imaging ranges and resolutions. In this study, we show that for active sonar systems up to 32 channels, the computation time can be significantly reduced by performing arithmetic optimizations, and by implementing the MVDR beamformer on a graphics processing unit (GPU). We point out important hardware limitations for these devices, and assess the design in terms of how efficiently it is able to use the GPU's resources. On a quad-core Intel Xeon system with a high-end Nvidia GPU, our GPU implementation renders more than a million pixels per second (1 MP/s). Compared to our initial central processing unit (CPU) implementation, the optimizations described herein led to a speedup of more than two orders of magnitude, or an expected five to ten times improvement had the CPU received similar optimization effort. This throughput enables real-time processing of sonar data, and makes the MVDR a viable alternative to conventional methods in practical systems.},

In particular, we derive expressions for the output power and the gain in the interference direction of the beamformer in terms of the source powers, correlation, and the sensor noise power, and show quantitatively the penalties arising from increasing correlation in several scenarios of interest. Next, we show that spatial smoothing progressively decorrelates the sources at a rate that depends on the spacing and directions of the sources, and thus relate the degree of smoothing to the improvement in signal cancellation and interference rejection behavior provided by spatial smoothing.

To achieve this performance, we make use of the parallel processing power found in modern graphics processing units (GPUs), combined with beamspace processing to reduce the computational complexity as the number of array elements increases. For a three-dimensional beamspace, we show that processing rates supporting real-time cardiac ultrasound imaging are possible, meaning that images can be processed faster than the image acquisition rate for a wide range of parameters. Image quality is investigated in an in vivo cardiac data set. These results show that Capon beamforming is feasible for cardiac ultrasound imaging, providing images with improved lateral resolution both in element-space and beamspace. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

The common methods for the implementation of analog beamformers for annular, linear/curved arrays, and phased arrays will be reviewed and the distinguishing characteristics identified. At the present time the industry is undergoing a major shift toward digital beamformation with the introduction of several commercial systems. Given that the earliest digital systems were available roughly 15 years ago, the introduction of digital beamformers has been relatively slow. Today this shift seems to be gaining momentum. Some of the factors causing these shifts are reviewed along the common types of designs and implementations.},

Distributed arrays have recently demonstrated a decreased sensitivity to environmental coherence loss and array mismatches. In an attempt to build upon this robustness, beamspace preprocessing is applied in this paper. Beamspace allows sector-focused beamforming and reduced computational complexity. A unique property of this implementation of beamspace, namely being indierent to losses of entire channels of data, has been demonstrated. This implementation of beamspace to Capon beamforming does not require beam orthogonalization, thus saving computational time, especially in whitening process.},

abstract = {Minimum variance (MV) beamforming has been studied for improving the performance of a diagnostic ultrasound imaging system. However, it is not easy for the MV beamforming to be implemented in a real-time ultrasound imaging system because of the enormous amount of computation time associated with the covariance matrix inversion. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a new fast MV beamforming method that almost optimally approximates the MV beamforming while reducing the computational complexity greatly through dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). The principal components are estimated offline from pre-calculated conventional MV weights. Thus, the proposed method does not directly calculate the MV weights but approximates them by a linear combination of a few selected dominant principal components. The combinational weights are calculated in almost the same way as in MV beamforming, but in the transformed domain of beamformer input signal by the PCA, where the dimension of the transformed covariance matrix is identical to the number of some selected principal component vectors. Both computer simulation and experiment were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method with echo signals from simulation as well as phantom and in vivo experiments. It is confirmed that our method can reduce the dimension of the covariance matrix down to as low as 2 × 2 while maintaining the good image quality of MV beamforming.},

abstract = {Currently, the nonadaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer is extensively used for ultrasound imaging, despite the fact that it has lower resolution and worse interference suppression capability than the adaptive standard Capon beamformer (SCB) if the steering vector corresponding to the signal of interest (SOI) is accurately known. The main problem which restricts the use of SCB, however, is that SCB lacks robustness against steering vector errors that are inevitable in practice. Whenever this happens, the performance of SCB may hecome worse than that of DAS. Therefore, a robust adaptive beamformer is desirable to maintain the robustness of DAS and adaptivity of SCB. In this paper we consider a recent promising robust Capon beamformer (RCB) for ultrasound imaging. We propose two ways of implementing RCB, one based on time delay and the other based on time reversal. RCB extends SCB by allowing the array steering vector to be within an uncertainty set. Hence, it restores the appeal of SCB including its high resolution and superb interference suppression capabilities, and also retains the attractiveness of DAS including its robustness against steering vector errors. The time-delay-based RCB can tolerate the misalignment of data samples and the time-reversal-based RCB can withstand the uncertainty of the Green's function. Both time-delay-based RCB and time-reversal-based RCB can be efficiently computed at a comparable cost to SCB. The excellent performances of the proposed robust adaptive beamforming approaches are demonstrated via a number of simulated and experimental examples.},

abstract = {Although they show potential to improve ultrasound image quality, plane wave (PW) compounding and synthetic aperture (SA) imaging are computationally demanding and are known to be challenging to implement in real-time. In this work, we have developed a novel beamformer architecture with the real-time parallel processing capacity needed to enable fast realization of PW compounding and SA imaging. The beamformer hardware comprises an array of graphics processing units (GPUs) that are hosted within the same computer workstation. Their parallel computational resources are controlled by a pixel-based software processor that includes the operations of analytic signal conversion, delay-and-sum beamforming, and recursive compounding as required to generate images from the channel-domain data samples acquired using PW compounding and SA imaging principles. When using two GTX-480 GPUs for beamforming and one GTX-470 GPU for recursive compounding, the beamformer can compute compounded 512 x 255 pixel PW and SA images at throughputs of over 4700 fps and 3000 fps, respectively, for imaging depths of 5 cm and 15 cm (32 receive channels, 40 MHz sampling rate). Its processing capacity can be further increased if additional GPUs or more advanced models of GPU are used.},

abstract = {The MVDR beamformer has been shown to improve active sonar image quality compared to conventional methods. Unfortunately, it is also significantly more computationally expensive because a spatial covariance matrix must be estimated and inverted for each image pixel. We target this challenge by altering and mapping the MVDR beamformer to a GPU, and suggest three different solutions depending on the system size. For systems with relatively few channels, we suggest arithmetic optimizations for the estimation step, and show how a GPU can be used to yield image creation rates of more than 1 Mpx/s. For larger systems we show that frequency domain processing is preferable, as this promotes high processing rates at a negligible reduction in image quality. These GPU implementations consistently reduced the runtime by 2 orders of magnitude compared to our reference C implementation. For even larger systems we suggest employing the LCA beamformer. It does not calculate a weightset, but merely computes the beamformer output for each of a predefined set of weights, and selects the one that best fulfils the MVDR criterion. The LCA creates images with a quality comparable to MVDR, and it is perfectly suited for a GPU. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract = {Adaptive beamforming has been well considered as a potential solution for improving the imaging quality of medical ultrasound systems. Despite the promised improvement in lateral resolution, image contrast and imaging penetration, the use of adaptive beamforming is substantially more computationally demanding than conventional delay-and-sum beamformers. While a dedicated hardware solution may be able to address the computational demand of one particular design, the need for an efficient algorithm exploration framework demands a platform solution that is high-performance and easily reprogrammable. To that end, the use of FPGA and GPU for implementing real-time adaptive beamforming on such platform has been explored. The results are evaluated quantitatively in terms of performance and image quality, and qualitatively with respect to ease of system integration and ease of use. In our test cases, both FPGA- and GPU-based solutions achieved real-time throughput exceeding 80 frames-per-second, and over 38x improvement when compared to our baseline CPU implementation. While the development time on GPU platform remains much lower than its FPGA counterpart, the FPGA solution is effective in providing the necessary I/O bandwidth to enable an end-to-end real-time reconfigurable image formation system.},

abstract = {In recent years, adaptive beamforming methods have been successfully applied to medical ultrasound imaging, resulting in simultaneous improvement in imaging resolution and contrast. These improvements have been achieved at the expense of higher computational complexity, with respect to the conventional non-adaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer, in which computational complexity is proportional to the number of elements, O(M). The computational overhead results from the covariance matrix inversion needed for computation of the adaptive weights, the complexity of which is cubic with the subarray size, O(L(3)). This is a computationally intensive procedure, which makes the implementation of adaptive beamformers less attractive in spite of their advantages. Considering that, in medical ultrasound applications, most of the energy is scattered from angles close to the steering angle, assuming spatial stationarity is a good approximation, allowing us to assume the Toeplitz structure for the estimated covariance matrix. Based on this idea, in this paper, we have applied the Toeplitz structure to the spatially smoothed covariance matrix by averaging the entries along all subdiagonals. Because the inverse of the resulting Toeplitz covariance matrix can be computed in O(L(2)) operations, this technique results in a greatly reduced computational complexity. By using simulated and experimental RF data-point targets as well as cyst phantoms-we show that the proposed low-complexity adaptive beamformer significantly outperforms the DAS and its performance is comparable to that of the minimum variance beamformer, with reduced computational complexity.},

abstract = {Recent developments in the capacity of modern Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have significantly expanded their applications. One such field is the acceleration of scientific computation and one type of calculation that is commonplace in scientific computation is the solution of systems of linear equations. A method that has proven in software to be very efficient and robust for finding such solutions is the Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm. In this article we present a widely parallel and deeply pipelined hardware CG implementation, targeted at modern FPGA architectures. This implementation is particularly suited for accelerating multiple small-to-medium-sized dense systems of linear equations and can be used as a stand-alone solver or as building block to solve higher-order systems. In this article it is shown that through parallelization it is possible to convert the computation time per iteration for an order n matrix from $\Theta$(n2) clock cycles on a microprocessor to $\Theta$(n) on a FPGA. Through deep pipelining it is also possible to solve several problems in parallel and maximize both performance and efficiency. I/O requirements are shown to be scalable and convergent to a constant value with the increase of matrix order. Post place-and-route results on a readily available VirtexII-6000 demonstrate sustained performance of 5 GFlops, and results on a Virtex5-330 indicate sustained performance of 35 GFlops. A comparison with an optimized software implementation running on a high-end CPU demonstrate that this FPGA implementation represents a significant speedup of at least an order of magnitude.},
