\begin{abstract}
The angular resolution and contrast in active sonar images depend on the beamformer's ability to receive signals from directions of interest, while suppressing noise and interference emanating from other directions. For sonar arrays, this is achieved by applying weights to the array channels.

While classical beamformers use predefined windows, adaptive beamformers estimate the optimal window by analytical evaluation of the data. The minimum variance (MV) beamformer, for instance, calculates the set of weights that minimises the variance of the beamformer's output. 

We have implemented a Low Complexity Adaptive (LCA) beamformer, which adaptively selects a window from a predefined set. The set is comprised of windows that are typical solutions found by the Minimum Variance method. The LCA beamformer was tested using simulated and experimental data from the Kongsberg Maritime HISAS 1030 sonar. On a simulated scene with speckle, highlight and shadow, the beamformer offered better lateral edge definition compared to the MV beamformer, and speckle intensity and shape comparable to DAS and MV beamformers. These results were verified by the experimental data.

An attactive trait of the LCA is its low computational complexity; while the MV beamformer is of O($M^3$), the LCA method is of O($MW$), with $M$ being the number of channels and $W$ the number of windows. We made the LCA perform like the MV method using a well designed set of 30 windows. Hence, unless the array is very small, the proposed method will perform like the MV beamformer or better, and at a fraction of the computational cost.

\section{Introduction}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.



\IEEEPARstart{A}{daptive} beamformers have only recently been introduced in active sonar imaging.\todo{break at something} This is because , as demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.7 and later.

We have implemented a Low Complexity Adaptive (LCA) beamformer, which adaptively selects a window from a predefined set. The set is comprised of windows that are typical solutions found by the Minimum Variance method. The LCA beamformer was tested using simulated and experimental data from the Kongsberg Maritime HISAS 1030 sonar. On a simulated scene with speckle, highlight and shadow, the beamformer offered better lateral edge definition compared to the MV beamformer, and speckle intensity and shape comparable to DAS and MV beamformers. These results were verified by the experimental data.

An attactive trait of the LCA is its low computational complexity; while the MV beamformer is of O($M^3$), the LCA method is of O($MW$), with $M$ being the number of channels and $W$ the number of windows. We made the LCA perform like the MV method using a well designed set of 30 windows. Hence, unless the array is very small, the proposed method will perform like the MV beamformer or better, and at a fraction of the computational cost.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% However, Computer Society journals sometimes do use bottom floats - bear
% this in mind when choosing appropriate optional arguments for the
% figure/table environments.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.

% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]

% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
