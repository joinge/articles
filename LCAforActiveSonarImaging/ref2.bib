abstract = {Minimum variance (MV) beamforming has been studied for improving the performance of a diagnostic ultrasound imaging system. However, it is not easy for the MV beamforming to be implemented in a real-time ultrasound imaging system because of the enormous amount of computation time associated with the covariance matrix inversion. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a new fast MV beamforming method that almost optimally approximates the MV beamforming while reducing the computational complexity greatly through dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). The principal components are estimated offline from pre-calculated conventional MV weights. Thus, the proposed method does not directly calculate the MV weights but approximates them by a linear combination of a few selected dominant principal components. The combinational weights are calculated in almost the same way as in MV beamforming, but in the transformed domain of beamformer input signal by the PCA, where the dimension of the transformed covariance matrix is identical to the number of some selected principal component vectors. Both computer simulation and experiment were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method with echo signals from simulation as well as phantom and in vivo experiments. It is confirmed that our method can reduce the dimension of the covariance matrix down to as low as 2 × 2 while maintaining the good image quality of MV beamforming.},

@article{Asl2012,
abstract = {In recent years, adaptive beamforming methods have been successfully applied to medical ultrasound imaging, resulting in simultaneous improvement in imaging resolution and contrast. These improvements have been achieved at the expense of higher computational complexity, with respect to the conventional non-adaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer, in which computational complexity is proportional to the number of elements, O(M). The computational overhead results from the covariance matrix inversion needed for computation of the adaptive weights, the complexity of which is cubic with the subarray size, O(L(3)). This is a computationally intensive procedure, which makes the implementation of adaptive beamformers less attractive in spite of their advantages. Considering that, in medical ultrasound applications, most of the energy is scattered from angles close to the steering angle, assuming spatial stationarity is a good approximation, allowing us to assume the Toeplitz structure for the estimated covariance matrix. Based on this idea, in this paper, we have applied the Toeplitz structure to the spatially smoothed covariance matrix by averaging the entries along all subdiagonals. Because the inverse of the resulting Toeplitz covariance matrix can be computed in O(L(2)) operations, this technique results in a greatly reduced computational complexity. By using simulated and experimental RF data-point targets as well as cyst phantoms-we show that the proposed low-complexity adaptive beamformer significantly outperforms the DAS and its performance is comparable to that of the minimum variance beamformer, with reduced computational complexity.},

abstract = {If an ultrasound imaging system provides a presentation of a moving object which is sensitive to small spatial shifts, the system is said to be locally spatially shift-variant. This can happen, for instance, if the axial or lateral sampling is insufficient. The Capon beamformer has been shown to provide increased lateral resolution in ultrasound images. Increased lateral resolution should demand denser lateral sampling. However, in previous literature on Capon beamforming for medical ultrasound imaging, only single-frame scenarios have been simulated. Temporal behavior and effects caused by the increased resolution and lack of oversampling have therefore been neglected. In this paper, we analyze the local lateral shift-invariance of the Capon beamformer when imaging moving objects. We show that insufficient lateral sampling makes an imaging system based on the Capon beamformer laterally shift-variant. Different methods for oversampling on transmit and receive are then discussed and investigated to improve on the Capon beamformer. It is shown that lateral shift-invariance can be improved by oversampling based on phase rotation on receive without affecting the acquisition frame rate and with a minor change in processing complexity.},

In this paper, we present an implementation of the Capon beamformer that exhibits realtime performance when applied in a typical cardiac ultrasound imaging setting. To achieve this performance, we make use of the parallel processing power found in modern graphics processing units (GPUs), combined with beamspace processing to reduce the computational complexity as the number of array elements increases. For a three-dimensional beamspace, we show that processing rates supporting real-time cardiac ultrasound imaging are possible, meaning that images can be processed faster than the image acquisition rate for a wide range of parameters. Image quality is investigated in an in vivo cardiac data set. These results show that Capon beamforming is feasible for cardiac ultrasound imaging, providing images with improved lateral resolution both in element-space and beamspace.},

abstract = {Medical ultrasound imaging is conventionally done by insonifying the imaged medium with focused beams. The backscattered echoes are beamformed using delay-and-sum operations that cannot completely eliminate the contribution of signals backscattered by structures off the imaging beam to the beamsum. It leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. This paper presents an adaptation of the Capon beamformer algorithm to ultrasound medical imaging with focused beams. The strategy is to apply data-dependent weight functions to the imaging aperture. These weights act as lateral spatial filters that filter out off-axis signals. The weights are computed for each point in the imaged medium, from the statistical analysis of the signals backscattered by that point to the different elements of the imaging probe when insonifying it with different focused beams. Phantom and in vivo images are presented to illustrate the benefits of the Capon algorithm over the conventional delay and-sum approach. On heart sector images, the clutter in the heart chambers is decreased. The endocardium border is better defined. On abdominal linear array images, significant contrast and resolution enhancement are observed.},

We demonstrate reduced mainlobe width and suppression of sidelobes on both simulated and experimental RF data of closely spaced wire targets, which gives potential contrast and resolution enhancement in medical images. The method is applied to experimental RF data from a heart phantom, in which we show increased resolution and improved definition of the ventricular walls. A potential weakness of adaptive beamformers is sensitivity to errors in the assumed wavefield parameters. We look at two ways to increase robustness of the proposed method; spatial smoothing and diagonal loading. We show that both are controlled by a single parameter that can move the performance from that of a MV beamformer to that of a DAS beamformer. We evaluate the sensitivity to velocity errors and show that reliable amplitude estimates are achieved while the mainlobe width and sidelobe levels are still significantly lower than for the conventional beamformer.},
