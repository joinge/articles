 
Dear Editor / Associate Editor

Please find enclosed our revised manuscript (in single and double column edition, both with and without diff from first submit) our manuscript "Low Complexity Adaptive Sonar Imaging" by Buskenes et al., which we would like to submit for publication as a peer-reviewed Journal Article in IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering (IEEE-JOE). We also supply answers to the reviewer's comments.

The Low Complexity Adaptive (LCA) beamformer originates from clinical ultrasound imaging. It uses the same minimum variance criterion as MVDR, but instead of computing an optimal array window it selects the best window out of a predefined set. Hence, it may be thought of as MVDR with a reduced and discrete solution space. Alternatively, it may be viewed as an advanced multi-apodization technique, where a larger amount of windows are used, and where micro-steered versions of them are allowed.

LCA has not yet been thoroughly introduced to active sonar imaging. It has been mentioned a few times by us in conference proceedings and in the PhD work by Ann A.E.Blomberg, but no one has attempted to answer which windows LCA should ideally choose from. The submitted article aims to shed light on these questions, and it is to date the most thorough study of the LCA method.

LCA is an attractive alternative to other adaptive beamformers due being simple to understand, easy to implement, near parameter-free and with an imaging performance similar to that of MVDR.

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. Also, all authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to the IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering (IEEE-JOE).

We look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
