% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

\IEEEPARstart{W}{ith} the introduction of a fast implementation of the Capon adaptive beamformer, a stream of images can now be processed at interactive frame rates \cite{Asen}. It is therefore an interesting question how a moving object appears after Capon beamforming has been applied. Earlier work on Capon beamforming for medical ultrasound imaging has investigated the method's capabilities in single frames only, and temporal behaviour and effects has therefore been neglected. 

An important property of an ultrasound imaging system is its local shift-invariance. Local shift-invariance means that an object’s appearance should be preserved when the object, or the ultrasound probe, is moved slightly. This invariance for local movements is what makes ultrasound imaging feasible in general, however it is specially important for quantitative techniques that correlate time-varying features, like pulsed doppler and flow imaging, and speckle tracking of tissue and blood. In this paper we analyze the shift-invariance property of the Capon beamformer by studying the beamformer output when applied on simulated and \textit{in vitro} images of moving objects. 

Capon beamforming has been shown to provide increased lateral resolution and contrast in ultrasound images \cite{Synnevag2007, Synnevag2009, Chen2011}. The method accomplish this by adjusting the array weights based on element-to-element covariance. Hence, the method yields data dependent weights. Capon beamforming is however also known for its suboptimal performance if the sample size available for covariance estimation is limited \cite{Mestre2006}, if correlated signals are present \cite{Widrow1982}, and if the assumed steering vector does not match the signal propagation vector \cite{Wax1996, Wax1996a}. This has led to the development of several robust versions of the Capon beamformer with e.g. spatial smoothing \cite{Shan1985} or diagonal loading \cite{JianLi2003} of the covariance estimate, or by applying steering vector uncertainty sets (SVUS) \cite{Lorenz2005, Rubsamen2013}. The first two, together with temporal smoothing of the covariance estimate, have been applied in earlier work on Capon beamforming for medical ultrasound imaging \cite{Synnevag2009}. The first two trades resolution for robustness and temporal smoothing helps to preserve speckle statistics \cite{Synnevag2007a}. SVUS has not been applied, even though it is well known that the Capon beamformer exhibits severe signal-nulling if the signal is present during the covariance estimation process and if this estimate is later used with a steering vector that does not match the signal propagation vector exactly. This self-nulling actually contribute a lot to the method's super resolution capability in passive-narrowband applications. 

In \cite{Cox1973}, Cox derives formulas for the resolution of the Capon beamformer (called the $\vec{k}_3$ processor), and presents in great detail how the amount of mismatch between the selected steering vector and the signal propagation vector impacts the beamformer output in simple situations. Cox states the following important fact about the Capon beamformer (the $\vec{k}_3$ processor): 
\begin{quote}
"\textit{... a $\vec{k}_3$ processor requires more closely spaced beams than a ... $\vec{k}_1$-processor in order to avoid serious signal suppression effects being introduced on signals arriving from directions between the beams}", 
\end{quote}
where $\vec{k}_1$ is the delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer. In Fig.\,\ref{fig:das_capon_beams} we have plotted the steered response for DAS and the Capon beamformer using (26) and (32) in \cite{Cox1973}. A 64-element linear array with $\lambda/2$ element spacing, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, is scanned over a sector equal to three times the system resolution. Impinging on the array is a monochromatic plane wave with a propagation vector orthogonal to the array surface normal with no spatially white noise present. Hence, the interference-noise matrix $\sigma_0^2\mat{Q}$ is the identity. We have also added the effect of typical subarray averaging and diagonal loading \cite{Asen} to the Capon beamformer output. The figure shows that when the DAS beamformer is used, only a 3.92 dB scallop loss \cite{Harris1978} should be observed if the source of the plane wave starts moving parallel to the array. However if the Capon beamformer is used with the beam density sufficient for DAS the scallop loss could be as large as $31$ dB. 

\begin{figure}[!t]

}
\caption{Comparison of drop in output power in between beams (half the system resolution) for delay-and-sum (DAS) and Capon beamforming.}
\label{fig:das_capon_beams}
\end{figure}

In previous literature on Capon beamforming for medical ultrasound imaging this effect has been passed over in silence (in single frames) by either oversampling on transmit, or carefully position point scatterers on transmit-receive beam pairs, or by ignorance. In this paper we show that when imaging a moving point scatterer with ultrasound and the Capon beamformer with the same beam spacing sufficient for DAS the same scallop loss is observed, manifested as oscillating point scatteres. The question is then, what can we do in order to improve on the situation.

\section{Background}

The standard form of time domain array beamforming is the delay-and-sum beamformer (DAS):
\begin{align}\label{eq:das}
z[n] = \sum_{m = 0}^{M-1}\vec{w}_m^*\vec{x}_m[n - \Delta_m[n]] = \vec{w}^H\vec{x}[n],
\end{align}
where $M$ is the number of elements or channels in the array, $\Delta_m[n]$ is the per-element focusing and steering delay, and $\vec{w}$ is a weight vector or window function. The weight vector is typically selected in order to trade resolution for a lower side lobe level.

\subsection{Capon Beamforming}
The Capon beamformer produce a weight vector, like the one in (\ref{eq:das}), based on the impinging signal and an optimization criteria. The minimization problem is as follow:
\begin{align}
&\min_{\vec{w}} E\{|z[n]|^2\} \rightarrow \min_{\vec{w}} \vec{w}^H \mat{\hat{R}} \vec{w} \label{eq:capon_optimization_criteria} \\
&\text{subjected to } \vec{w}^H\vec{a} = 1,
\end{align}
where $\mat{\hat{R}}$ is a sample covariance matrix. Hence, the resulting weight vector will minimizes the output power while maintaining unit gain in the steering direction $\vec{a}$. %The covariance matrix is usually unknown and has to be estimated from the element data. The covariance matrix in (\ref{eq:capon_optimization_criteria}) is therefore substituted with the sample covariance matrix.

The sample covariance matrix can be estimated for an active system in the following way \cite{Synnevag2009}:
\begin{align}
\mat{\breve{R}}[n] = \frac{1}{N_LN_K}\sum_{n'=n-K}^{n+K} \sum_{l=0}^{N_L-1} \vec{x}_l[n']\vec{x}_l[n']^H,
\end{align}
where $K = M-L+1$ typically is proportional to the pulse length, $N_K = 2K + 1$, $N_L = M-L+1$, and $\vec{x}_l$ is the $l\text{th}$ subarray $[x_l[n], \dotso x_{l+L}[n]]$ of length $L$. Finally the matrix is loaded with a diagonal factor for numerical stability and increased robustness, 
\begin{align}
\epsilon &= d*\text{trace}\{\mat{\breve{R}}\}/L\\
\mat{\hat{R}} &= \mat{\breve{R}} + \epsilon\mat{I}.
\end{align} 

The solution to the minimization problem in (\ref{eq:capon_optimization_criteria}) is
\begin{align}
\vec{w}[n] = \frac{\mat{\hat{R}}[n]^{-1}\vec{a}}{\vec{a}^H\mat{\hat{R}}[n]^{-1}\vec{a}} \in \mathbb{C}^L.
\end{align}

Note that one matrix has to be constructed and inverted for each data vector $\vec{x}[n]$ received by the system. This is indeed computational demanding, but following the innovation in GPU computing, and by applying a novel method in order to reduce the size of the matrix inversion problem \cite{Nilsen2009}, real time processing is now possible \cite{Asen}.

%Nilsen et. al has proposed to apply beamspace processing to further reduce the computations required. With beamspace we mean transforming the channel data from element space to a fan of beams covering the imaging sector, $\vec{x}_{BS} = \mat{B}x$.  The steering vectors in $\mat{B}$, the so-called Butler matrix, determines each beams direction in space. We can therefore easily remove beams where no interference is present by removing rows in $\mat{B}$. For a focused system like medical ultrasound, where the received signal is concentrated in a narrow band around broadside, there is a small percentage of the beams that contains almost all of the energy. Nilsen et. al has shown that as little as three beams still produced results comparable with applying the full Capon estimation in element space.

\subsection{Lateral Sampling and Shift-Invariance}

The lateral sampling of an ultrasound image is given by the aperture size on transmit ($D_{tx}$) and receive ($D_{rx}$) combined \cite{Hergum2007} and the center frequency ($f_c = c/\lambda$), where $c$ is the speed of sound in the media and $\lambda_c$ is the wavelength of the center frequency. The required Nyquist beam spacing is then:
\begin{align}
\Delta < \frac{\lambda}{D_{tx} + D_{rx}}. \label{eq:resolution}
\end{align}
If this requirement is not fulfilled, aliasing effects will appear in the image and the system will not be lateral shift-invariant.

In order to visualize the local lateral shift-invariance of a given imaging system, we will use lateral shift-variance plots (LSV-plots), introduced by Hergum \textit{et al.} \cite{Hergum2007}. A LSV-plot is constructed for a given imaging system by imaging a laterally moving point scatterer. For each lateral position the root-mean-square (RMS) is calculated in range, and the resulting beam profiles are stacked in order to produce an image. The image is displayed as a contour plot with a contour on -1, -2, -3, -6, -12 and -24 dB. The maximum for each beam profile is also marked with a black dot. The system is said to be local lateral shift-invariant if the contours are straight diagonals, hence the diagonals have constant amplitude.

To further quantify the shift-invariance we have calculated the mean absolute error (MAE) of the maximum point in each beam profile versus $f(x)=x$ (P-MAE), and the negative MAE of the amplitude variation for the same set of points (A-MAE). The first measure quantifies the amount of geometric distortion, and the latter quantifies the gain variation or in our case the loss of signal. The maximum amplitude deviation along the max-point trace is therefore also highly interesting. We present all these numbers together with the LSV-plots.

Fig.\,\ref{fig:das_shiftinvariant} presents a LSV-plot for imaging system using DAS beamforming and with a beam spacing following (\ref{eq:resolution}).

\section{Results}\label{sec:res}

Make plot of contrast between two areas in a simulation for different values of $L$. Make the same plot for different number of rx beams. Do the same for an in-vivo image. The rational being that contrast is also improved by denser rx-sampling not just shift-invariance. 

\subsection{In-vitro Images}
Acquire channel data from a phantom containing point wire targets and cysts while moving the probe laterally. Confirm the improved shift-invariance when using phase rotation. 

\subsection{In-Vivo Images}
Investigate if phase rotation improves contrast in in-vivo images of the heart.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:dis}
Discuss results presented in Section \ref{sec:res}.

The figure below shows a lateral shift invariance plots for a well sampled delay-and-sum image (a), the same sampling with Capon processing (b), and 4x over sampling processed with Capon. The shift invariance plots the beamprofile (TODO: Make the shift invariance plot). The results show that when using the Capon beamformer we have to over sample with a factor four to remove the blinking artifact. This can be done without affecting frame rate by using the available parallel receive-lines found on most ultrasound systems. May also use phase rotation. 

TODO: Add citations – Hergum/Bjåstad Local shift invariance and MLA’s… Is there any publications stating that Capon do not work on moving objects?

\subsection{Impact on Real Time Performance}
Discuss, and show with benchmarks how the different methods for making Capon beamforming shift-invariant impact the total execution time.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
