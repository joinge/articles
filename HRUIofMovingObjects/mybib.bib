abstract = {The classical problem of choosing apodization functions for a beamformer involves a trade-off between main lobe width and side lobe level, i.e., a trade-off between resolution and contrast. To avoid this trade-off, the application of adaptive beamforming, such as minimum variance beamforming, to medical ultrasound imaging has been suggested. This has been an active topic of research in medical ultrasound imaging in the recent years, and several authors have demonstrated significant improvements in image resolution. However, the improvement comes at a considerable cost. Where the complexity of a conventional beamformer is linear with the number of elements [O(M)], the complexity of a minimum variance beamformer is as high as O(MÂ³). In this paper, we have applied a method based on an idea by Vignon and Burcher which is data-adaptive, but selects the apodization function between several predefined windows, giving linear complexity. In the proposed method, we select an apodization function for each depth along a scan line based on the optimality criterion of the minimum variance beamformer. However, unlike the minimum variance beamformer, which has an infinite solution space, we limit the number of possible outcomes to a set of predefined windows. The complexity of the method is then only P times that of the conventional method, where P is the number of predefined windows. The suggested method gives significant improvement in image resolution at a low cost. The method is robust, can handle coherent targets, and is easy to implement. It may also be used as a classifier because the selected window gives information about the object being imaged. We have applied the method to simulated data of wire targets and a cyst phantom, and to experimental RF data from a heart phantom using P = 4 and P = 12. The results show significant improvement in image resolution compared with delay-and-sum.},

abstract = {Recently, significant improvement in image resolution has been demonstrated by applying adaptive beamforming to medical ultrasound imaging. In this paper, we have used the minimum-variance beamformer to show how the low sidelobe levels and narrow beamwidth of adaptive methods can be used, not only to increase resolution, but also to enhance imaging in several ways. By using a minimum-variance beamformer instead of delay-and-sum on reception, reduced aperture, higher frame rates, or increased depth of penetration can be achieved without sacrificing image quality. We demonstrate comparable resolution on images of wire targets and a cyst phantom obtained with a 96-element, 18.5-mm transducer using delay-and-sum, and a 48-element, 9.25-mm transducer using minimum variance. To increase frame rate, fewer and wider transmit beams in combination with several parallel receive beams may be used. We show comparable resolution to delay-and-sum using minimum variance, 1/4th of the number of transmit beams and 4 parallel receive beams, potentially increasing the frame rate by 4. Finally, we show that by lowering the frequency of the transmitted beam and beamforming the received data with the minimum variance beamformer, increased depth of penetration is achieved without sacrificing lateral resolution.},

@article{Nilsen2009,
abstract = {Applying the Capon adaptive beamformer in medical ultrasound imaging results in enhanced resolution by improving the interference-suppressing capabilities of the array. This improvement comes at the expense of an increased computational complexity. We have investigated the application of a beamspace adaptive beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging, which can be used to achieve reduced computational complexity with performance comparable to that of the Capon beamformer. The idea behind beamspace beamforming is that, instead of using the spatial statistics of the elements in the array to differentiate between signals and interference, we use the spatial statistics of a set of orthogonal beams, which are formed in different directions. This represents a shift from element space to beamspace. Because the majority of interference in medical ultrasound imaging is constrained to a limited spatial interval due to the focused transmit beam, this latter space can be reduced to a dimension that is lower than that of element space. We show, using simulations and experimental data, that this dimension can be selected as low as 3 while still achieving performance comparable to its element space counterpart.},

@article{Hall2010,
abstract = {Ultrasonic guided wave imaging with a sparse, or spatially distributed, array can detect and localize damage over large areas. Conventional delay-and-sum images from such an array typically have a relatively high noise floor, however, and contain artifacts that often cannot be discriminated from damage. Considered here is minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) imaging, which is a variation of delay-and-sum imaging whereby weighting coefficients are adaptively computed at each pixel location. Utilization of MVDR significantly improves image quality compared with delay-and-sum imaging, and additional improvements are obtained from incorporation of a priori scattering information in the MVDR method, use of phase information, and instantaneous windowing. Simulated data from a through-hole scatterer are used to illustrate performance improvements, and a performance metric is proposed that allows for quantitative comparisons of images from a known scatterer. Experimental results from a through-hole scatterer are also provided that illustrate imaging efficacy.},

@article{Wang2009,
abstract = {Some success has been demonstrated in the extensive studies of adaptive imaging, but these approaches are generally not suitable for high-frame-rate (HFR) imaging where broad transmit beams are required. In this study, we propose an effective adaptive imaging method suitable for HFR imaging based on coherence-factor (CF) weighting and the minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) method. The CF is an index of focusing quality estimated from receive-channel data in which the amplitude of each image pixel is weighted by the corresponding CF so as to reduce the unwanted sidelobes. Direct implementation of CF weighting in HFR imaging does not provide satisfactory results because the broad transmit beams required for HFR imaging reduce the accuracy of CF calculations. In this study, we alleviated this problem by applying the MVDR method. We test the proposed method with the synthetic transmit aperture method where only 8 firings are required to form an image. Both simulations and clinical breast imaging data were used, and the proposed method enhanced the mean contrast by around 4.6 dB and the mean contrast-to-noise ratio by around 20\%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective at improving the image quality.},

@article{Asl2009,
abstract = {Currently, the nonadaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer is used in medical ultrasound imaging. However, due to its data-independent nature, DAS leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. In this paper, an adaptive minimum variance (MV)-based beamformer that combines the MV and coherence factor (CF) weighting is introduced and adapted to medical ultrasound imaging. MV-adaptive beamformers can improve the image quality in terms of resolution and sidelobes by suppressing off-axis signals, while keeping onaxis ones. In addition, CF weighting can improve contrast and sidelobes by emphasizing the in-phase signals and reducing the out-of-phase ones. Combining MV and CF weighting results in simultaneous improvement of imaging resolution and contrast, outperforming both DAS and MV beamformers. In addition, because of the power of CF in reducing the focusing errors, the proposed method presents satisfactory robustness against sound velocity inhomogeneities, outperforming the regularized MV beamformer. The excellent performance of the proposed beamforming approach is demonstrated by several simulated examples.},

@article{Holfort2009,
abstract = {A minimum variance (MV) approach for near-field beamforming of broadband data is proposed. The approach is implemented in the frequency domain, and it provides a set of adapted, complex apodization weights for each frequency subband. The performance of the proposed MV beamformer is tested on simulated data obtained using Field II. The method is validated using synthetic aperture data and data obtained from a plane wave emission. Data for 13 point targets and a circular cyst with a radius of 5 mm are simulated. The performance of the MV beamformer is compared with delay-and-sum (DS) using boxcar weights and Hanning weights and is quantified by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the peak-side-lobe level (PSL). Single emission \{DS boxcar, DS Hanning, MV\} provide a PSL of \{-16, -36, -49\} dB and a FWHM of \{0.79, 1.33, 0.08\} mm. Using all 128 emissions, \{DS boxcar, DS Hanning, MV\} provides a PSL of \{-32, -49, -65\} dB, and a FWHM of \{0.63, 0.97, 0.08\} mm. The contrast of the beamformed single emission responses of the circular cyst was calculated as \{-18, -37, -40\} dB. The simulations have shown that the frequency subband MV beamformer provides a significant increase in lateral resolution compared with DS, even when using considerably fewer emissions. An increase in resolution is seen when using only one single emission. Furthermore, the effect of steering vector errors is investigated. The steering vector errors are investigated by applying an error of the sound speed estimate to the ultrasound data. As the error increases, it is seen that the MV beamformer is not as robust compared with the DS beamformer with boxcar and Hanning weights. Nevertheless, it is noted that the DS does not outperform the MV beamformer. For errors of 2\% and 4\% of the correct value, the FWHM are \{0.81, 1.25, 0.34\} mm and \{0.89, 1.44, 0.46\} mm, respectively.},
