Although time-reversal MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) is known for its super-resolution ability in localization of point scatterers, in the presence of noise this super-resolution property will easily break down. In this paper a phase-coherent version of time-reversal MUSIC is proposed, which can overcome this fundamental limit. The algorithm has been tested employing synthetic multiple scattering data based on the Foldy-Lax model, as well as experimental ultrasound data acquired in a water tank. Using a limited frequency band, it was demonstrated that the phase-coherent MUSIC algorithm has the potential of giving significantly better resolved scatterer locations than standard time-reversal MUSIC.},

Inadequate estimation of the covariance matrix results in adapted antenna patterns with high sidelobes and distorted mainbeams. A technique to reduce these effects by modifying the covariance matrix estimate is described from the point of view of eigenvector decomposition. This diagonal loading technique reduces the system nulling capability against low-level interference, but parametric studies show that it is an effective approach in many situations},

abstract = {The Capon (1969) beamformer has better resolution and much better interference rejection capability than the standard (data-independent) beamformer, provided that the array steering vector corresponding to the signal of interest (SOI) is accurately known. However, whenever the knowledge of the SOI steering vector is imprecise (as is often the case in practice), the performance of the Capon beamformer may become worse than that of the standard beamformer. Diagonal loading (including its extended versions) has been a popular approach to improve the robustness of the Capon beamformer. We show that a natural extension of the Capon beamformer to the case of uncertain steering vectors also belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches, but the amount of diagonal loading can be precisely calculated based on the uncertainty set of the steering vector. The proposed robust Capon beamformer can be efficiently computed at a comparable cost with that of the standard Capon beamformer. Its excellent performance for SOI power estimation is demonstrated via a number of numerical examples.},

@article{Rubsamen2013,
abstract = {The standard Capon beamformer (SCB) achieves the maximum output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio in the error-free case. However, estimation errors of the signal steering vector and the array covariance matrix can result in severe performance deteriorations of the SCB, especially if the training data contains the desired signal component. A popular technique to improve the robustness against model errors is to compute the Capon beamformer with the maximum output power, considering an uncertainty set for the signal steering vector. However, maximizing the total beamformer output power may result in an insufficient suppression of interferers and noise. As an alternative approach to mitigate the detrimental effect of model errors, we propose to compute the Capon beamformer with the minimum sensitivity, considering the uncertainty set for the signal steering vector. The proposed maximally robust Capon beamformer (MRCB) is at least as robust as the maximum output power Capon beamformer with the same uncertainty set for the signal steering vector. We show that the MRCB can be implemented efficiently using Lagrange duality. Simulation results demonstrate that the MRCB outperforms state-of-the-art robust adaptive beamformers in many scenarios.},

abstract = {An important problem in adaptive beamforming algorithm design is robustness to steering vector uncertainty. A white-noise gain constraint (WNGC) has historically been an effective approach. Recently, the robust Capon beamforming class of algorithms has been developed to provide robustness through the use of a steering vector uncertainty region and an implicit steering vector estimation step as part of the beamformer. Like WNGC, the RCB algorithm can be shown to produce weight vectors based upon a diagonal loading of the covariance matrix. This paper provides some direct comparison of WNGC and RCB approaches for scenarios of interest. Geometrical interpretations of RCB algorithms provide insights to their optimality. Both approaches have a parameter than can be used to tune the performance from aggressive to conservative. Major observed differences are that RCB provides more accurate power estimates, focuses its high loading more locally, but exhibits higher white noise gain near sources.},
