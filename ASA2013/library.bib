@article{Chen,
abstract = {Adaptive beamforming has been well considered as a potential solution for improving the imaging quality of medical ultrasound systems. Despite the promised improvement in lateral resolution, image contrast and imaging penetration, the use of adaptive beamforming is substantially more computationally demanding than conventional delay-and-sum beamformers. While a dedicated hardware solution may be able to address the computational demand of one particular design, the need for an efficient algorithm exploration framework demands a platform solution that is high-performance and easily reprogrammable. To that end, the use of FPGA and GPU for implementing real-time adaptive beamforming on such platform has been explored. The results are evaluated quantitatively in terms of performance and image quality, and qualitatively with respect to ease of system integration and ease of use. In our test cases, both FPGA- and GPU-based solutions achieved real-time throughput exceeding 80 frames-per-second, and over 38x improvement when compared to our baseline CPU implementation. While the development time on GPU platform remains much lower than its FPGA counterpart, the FPGA solution is effective in providing the necessary I/O bandwidth to enable an end-to-end real-time reconfigurable image formation system.},

@article{Faulkner2010,
abstract = {Beamforming is central to the processing function of all phased arrays and becomes particularly challenging with a large number of antenna element (e.g. >100,000). The ability to beamform efficiently with reasonable power requirements is discussed in this paper. Whilst the most appropriate beamforming technology will change over time due to semiconductor and processing developments, we present a hierarchical structure which is technology agnostic and describe both Radio-Frequency (RF) and digital hierarchical beamforming approaches. We present implementations of both RF and digital beamforming systems on two antenna array demonstrators, namely the Electronic Multi Beam Radio Astronomy ConcEpt (EMBRACE) and the dualpolarisation all-digital array (2-PAD). This paper will compare and contrast both digital and analogue implementations without considering the deep system design of these arrays.},

abstract = {Applying the Capon adaptive beamformer in medical ultrasound imaging results in enhanced resolution by improving the interference-suppressing capabilities of the array. This improvement comes at the expense of an increased computational complexity. We have investigated the application of a beamspace adaptive beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging, which can be used to achieve reduced computational complexity with performance comparable to that of the Capon beamformer. The idea behind beamspace beamforming is that, instead of using the spatial statistics of the elements in the array to differentiate between signals and interference, we use the spatial statistics of a set of orthogonal beams, which are formed in different directions. This represents a shift from element space to beamspace. Because the majority of interference in medical ultrasound imaging is constrained to a limited spatial interval due to the focused transmit beam, this latter space can be reduced to a dimension that is lower than that of element space. We show, using simulations and experimental data, that this dimension can be selected as low as 3 while still achieving performance comparable to its element space counterpart.},

abstract = {Recent developments in the capacity of modern Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have significantly expanded their applications. One such field is the acceleration of scientific computation and one type of calculation that is commonplace in scientific computation is the solution of systems of linear equations. A method that has proven in software to be very efficient and robust for finding such solutions is the Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm. In this article we present a widely parallel and deeply pipelined hardware CG implementation, targeted at modern FPGA architectures. This implementation is particularly suited for accelerating multiple small-to-medium-sized dense systems of linear equations and can be used as a stand-alone solver or as building block to solve higher-order systems. In this article it is shown that through parallelization it is possible to convert the computation time per iteration for an order n matrix from $\Theta$(n2) clock cycles on a microprocessor to $\Theta$(n) on a FPGA. Through deep pipelining it is also possible to solve several problems in parallel and maximize both performance and efficiency. I/O requirements are shown to be scalable and convergent to a constant value with the increase of matrix order. Post place-and-route results on a readily available VirtexII-6000 demonstrate sustained performance of 5 GFlops, and results on a Virtex5-330 indicate sustained performance of 35 GFlops. A comparison with an optimized software implementation running on a high-end CPU demonstrate that this FPGA implementation represents a significant speedup of at least an order of magnitude.},

Distributed arrays have recently demonstrated a decreased sensitivity to environmental coherence loss and array mismatches. In an attempt to build upon this robustness, beamspace preprocessing is applied in this paper. Beamspace allows sector-focused beamforming and reduced computational complexity. A unique property of this implementation of beamspace, namely being indierent to losses of entire channels of data, has been demonstrated. This implementation of beamspace to Capon beamforming does not require beam orthogonalization, thus saving computational time, especially in whitening process.},

abstract = {We have applied the minimum variance (MV) adaptive beamformer to medical ultrasound imaging and shown significant improvement in image quality compared to delay-and-sum (DAS). We demonstrate reduced mainlobe width and suppression of sidelobes on both simulated and experimental RF data of closely spaced wire targets, which gives potential contrast and resolution enhancement in medical images. The method is applied to experimental RF data from a heart phantom, in which we show increased resolution and improved definition of the ventricular walls. A potential weakness of adaptive beamformers is sensitivity to errors in the assumed wavefield parameters. We look at two ways to increase robustness of the proposed method; spatial smoothing and diagonal loading. We show that both are controlled by a single parameter that can move the performance from that of a MV beamformer to that of a DAS beamformer. We evaluate the sensitivity to velocity errors and show that reliable amplitude estimates are achieved while the mainlobe width and sidelobe levels are still significantly lower than for the conventional beamformer.},

abstract = {Medical ultrasound imaging is conventionally done by insonifying the imaged medium with focused beams. The backscattered echoes are beamformed using delay-and-sum operations that cannot completely eliminate the contribution of signals backscattered by structures off the imaging beam to the beamsum. It leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. This paper presents an adaptation of the Capon beamformer algorithm to ultrasound medical imaging with focused beams. The strategy is to apply data-dependent weight functions to the imaging aperture. These weights act as lateral spatial filters that filter out off-axis signals. The weights are computed for each point in the imaged medium, from the statistical analysis of the signals backscattered by that point to the different elements of the imaging probe when insonifying it with different focused beams. Phantom and in vivo images are presented to illustrate the benefits of the Capon algorithm over the conventional delay and-sum approach. On heart sector images, the clutter in the heart chambers is decreased. The endocardium border is better defined. On abdominal linear array images, significant contrast and resolution enhancement are observed.},

abstract = {Some success has been demonstrated in the extensive studies of adaptive imaging, but these approaches are generally not suitable for high-frame-rate (HFR) imaging where broad transmit beams are required. In this study, we propose an effective adaptive imaging method suitable for HFR imaging based on coherence-factor (CF) weighting and the minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) method. The CF is an index of focusing quality estimated from receive-channel data in which the amplitude of each image pixel is weighted by the corresponding CF so as to reduce the unwanted sidelobes. Direct implementation of CF weighting in HFR imaging does not provide satisfactory results because the broad transmit beams required for HFR imaging reduce the accuracy of CF calculations. In this study, we alleviated this problem by applying the MVDR method. We test the proposed method with the synthetic transmit aperture method where only 8 firings are required to form an image. Both simulations and clinical breast imaging data were used, and the proposed method enhanced the mean contrast by around 4.6 dB and the mean contrast-to-noise ratio by around 20\%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective at improving the image quality.},

@article{Wang2005,
abstract = {Currently, the nonadaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer is extensively used for ultrasound imaging, despite the fact that it has lower resolution and worse interference suppression capability than the adaptive standard Capon beamformer (SCB) if the steering vector corresponding to the signal of interest (SOI) is accurately known. The main problem which restricts the use of SCB, however, is that SCB lacks robustness against steering vector errors that are inevitable in practice. Whenever this happens, the performance of SCB may hecome worse than that of DAS. Therefore, a robust adaptive beamformer is desirable to maintain the robustness of DAS and adaptivity of SCB. In this paper we consider a recent promising robust Capon beamformer (RCB) for ultrasound imaging. We propose two ways of implementing RCB, one based on time delay and the other based on time reversal. RCB extends SCB by allowing the array steering vector to be within an uncertainty set. Hence, it restores the appeal of SCB including its high resolution and superb interference suppression capabilities, and also retains the attractiveness of DAS including its robustness against steering vector errors. The time-delay-based RCB can tolerate the misalignment of data samples and the time-reversal-based RCB can withstand the uncertainty of the Green's function. Both time-delay-based RCB and time-reversal-based RCB can be efficiently computed at a comparable cost to SCB. The excellent performances of the proposed robust adaptive beamforming approaches are demonstrated via a number of simulated and experimental examples.},

abstract = {Although they show potential to improve ultrasound image quality, plane wave (PW) compounding and synthetic aperture (SA) imaging are computationally demanding and are known to be challenging to implement in real-time. In this work, we have developed a novel beamformer architecture with the real-time parallel processing capacity needed to enable fast realization of PW compounding and SA imaging. The beamformer hardware comprises an array of graphics processing units (GPUs) that are hosted within the same computer workstation. Their parallel computational resources are controlled by a pixel-based software processor that includes the operations of analytic signal conversion, delay-and-sum beamforming, and recursive compounding as required to generate images from the channel-domain data samples acquired using PW compounding and SA imaging principles. When using two GTX-480 GPUs for beamforming and one GTX-470 GPU for recursive compounding, the beamformer can compute compounded 512 x 255 pixel PW and SA images at throughputs of over 4700 fps and 3000 fps, respectively, for imaging depths of 5 cm and 15 cm (32 receive channels, 40 MHz sampling rate). Its processing capacity can be further increased if additional GPUs or more advanced models of GPU are used.},
