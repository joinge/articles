\begin{abstract}
\todo{Revise abstract, and make a point of the notation system}Template matching is a common technique for automatic classification of objects in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images. The principle is to isolate an image segment containing the object of interest, correlate it with a set of template images, and assign it to the class of the template yielding the highest correlation coefficient. The challenge is to come up with a representative set of template images covering the relevant configurations of object and seabed.

We target this challenge with a sonar simulator that first takes as input a seabed model derived from the real sonar image. Then it places a 3D object model on the seabed, renders the scene, and adds the resulting image to the template set. For every object type, position, alignment and material, the procedure is repeated, and a correlation coefficient computed. The best performance is obtained when these parameters are estimated from the sonar image as part of the classification process. The simulator is therefore written in OpenGL and OpenCL and runs on graphics processing units (GPUs). The result is a fast performing and portable template generator which can adapt to the characteristics of the current scene on-the-fly.

%
\figstep{1}{\emph{Model displacement.} When the 3D models of seafloor and object are loaded into OpenGL they each have with their own reference frame $\protect\ubar{M}$. The image region we seek to image has a position and orientation $\ubar{I}$. We apply the displacement (translation and rotation) of $\ubar{M}$ relative to $\protect\ubar{I}$ with a \emph{model matrix} $\mat{T}_\textit{\tiny\!IM}$.
}\\[.5\baselineskip]
%
\figstep{2}{\emph{Sonar translation.} The sonar local body has the reference frame $\ubar{S}$. Its orientation is equal to that of the image, $\uvec{S}=\uvec{I}$. We apply the remaining translation of $\udot{I}$ relative to  $\udot{S}$ with a \emph{sonar matrix} $\mat{T}_\textit{\tiny\!SI}$.
}\\[.5\baselineskip]
%
\figstep{3}{\emph{Orthogonal rotation.} We want to position the OpenGL camera at the origin of the sonar frame, $\udot{S}$, looking at (i.e. $z$-axis pointing at) the origin of the image frame, $\udot{I}$. While the  position is correct after step 2, we must apply the rotation of $\uvec{S}$ relative to $\uvec{O}$ with a \emph{orthogonal view matrix} $\mat{T}_\textit{\tiny\!SI}$.
}\\[.5\baselineskip]
%
\figstep{4}{\emph{Coordinate conversion.} The $\hat{x}_O$ and $\hat{y}_O$ axes span an orthogonal viewing plane that the image points can be projected onto. However, to simplify the boundary specification of range and elevation in the next step, we convert the coordinate representation from cartesian $\uvec{O}=(x,y_O,z_O)$ to cylindrical $\uvec{C}=(x,\phi_C,r_C)$ with the non-linear function T$_{CO}$.
}\\[.5\baselineskip]
%
\figstep{5}{\emph{Projection}. OpenGL unly renders coordinates that fall in the range $[-1,1]$. We map the coordinate boundaries (for along-track, range and elevation) into this normalized range with a \emph{projection matrix} $\mat{T}_\textit{\tiny\!XC}$.
% 
% The size of this plane is determined by the desired image region on the seafloor. The projection is performed with the \emph{projection matrix} $\mat{T}_\textit{\tiny\!C}$.
}\\[.5\baselineskip]
%
\figstep{6}{\emph{OpenGL rendering.} When OpenGL renders the scene it uses a \emph{vertex shader} to apply our transformation matrices to every vertex, and a \emph{fragment shader} to compute the intensity values for each point in the image. OpenGL computes the range from each image pixel to its corresponding model facet: This is called a \emph{depth map}.
}\\[.5\baselineskip]
%
\figstep{7}{\emph{OpenCL post-processing.} Finally, the sonar-like image is formed---for some unique azimuth coordinate---by accumulating all intensity values that share the same range. This is our template. %  along with the depth information is finally combined to form a sonar like image. This is our template.

% Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). When an AUV with a sonar imaging system encounter an interesting object, it would be very beneficial if adapted its behavior to examine the object further. This is challenging as it would need to learn in what ways the interesting objects differ from the background, i.e. it relies on previous knowledge. It would also need to process this information is near real-time to act in an efficient manner.

% - Adapt simulation to its behaviour, see if they still match.


\IEEEPARstart{A}{utonomous} underwater vehicles (AUVs) are vital in the exploration of our underwater frontiers. When equipped with a modern synthetic aperture sonar (SAS), they map seafloors, survey underwater biology, help localize wrecks, inspect oil pipes, fields and electricity lines, or help remove mines, biohazard waste or plastic. However, they struggle to deal with unforeseen events, such as poor imaging conditions, blocked paths, corrupted data or rare objects. One reason is their lack of a reliable and adaptive system for automatic target recognition (ATR).

%However, Such independent systems have much to gain from being able to adapt to the scenario at hand. For instance, with a well designed automatic target recognition (ATR) system on board they can adapt their mission plan to collect more information on particularly interesting objects, or fine-tune the sonar and navigation system to create better images.
 
% Automatic target recognition (ATR) is an important component in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), as it allows the vehicle to adapt its mission plan to e.g. revisit detected objects for closer examination. One way to classify these objects is by using template matching. The principle involved  is to isolate an image segment containing the object of interest, compare it with a set of template images of the relevant object classes, and assign it to the class of the template with the the best fit.

A conventional ATR system isolates an object of interest, extracts its key features, and uses these to estimate the object's class. The challenge is to find features that are unique and intrinsic, such as type, shape and size, independent of extrinsic ones such as alignment, burial depth, degeneration level or view angle. Such features are rare in SAS, despite its best-in-class resolution and dynamic range, due to image ambiguities from acoustical distortions such as layover, multiple scattering, diffraction, dispersion and penetration.

%Thus, the sonar image contains incomplete object information, and only contains partial object can only describe the object partially, can't be used to infer the object class unambiguously.

Template matching offers an alternative to feature extraction: to compare the object with image templates of relevant classes and orientations, and assign the object to the class that fits best. The problem is to find a set of templates that properly represent the objects. Too many templates are needed to densely sample each degree of freedom. Therefore, practical implementations resort to a few sparsely sampled features, ultimately yielding inaccurate results~\cite{Midelfart2010}.

%Numerous templates are required for each object, since every degree of freedom needed to describe it adds a dimension to the template solution space\todo{simplify}.

%Template matching offers an alternative approach: Here an isolated image segment is compared to a set of template images covering the relevant object classes and orientations, and assigned to the class of the template with the best fit. Since the templates are computed from 3D models, this reduces the issue of image ambiguity. 

%However, it is challenging to find a static set of templates covering all suitable configurations of object and seafloor. Another issue is that the size of pre-computed library of templates grows exponentially with the number of parameters needed, assuming similar sampling granularity of each parameter. This limits its use to only a few parameters being coarsely sampled, ultimately yielding inaccurate results~\cite{Midelfart2010}.

Adaptive template matching is a hybrid solution: to extract the most reliable statistics from the image, such as shadow and highlight characteristics, and use these to limit the template solution space~\cite{Midelfart2010}. This enables a fine-grained search through more features, at a reduced computational load and improved accuracy. However, we can remove a template library completely by simulating the templates on-the-fly.

%\todo{However, only a few simulators for high frequency, side-looking sonar imagery have been published. ***}
A few simulators for high frequency, side-looking sonar imagery have been published, e.g.~\cite{Bell1997,Sammelm2003}. We seek a fast simulator for creating simple templates, but most implementations prioritize accurate acoustic modeling at the expense of execution speed. One exception is the SIGMAS+ simulator~\cite{Coiras2009a, Coiras2009b}, which is accelerated by the parallel computing power of graphics processing units (GPUs). Aligning with our goals, it assumes Lambertian scattering and creates the sonar image from a 3D model with multiple renderings by the OpenGL computer graphics library. However, it includes stochastic effects such as ambient noise, which we deem irrelevant for templates, and its OpenGL-centric nature makes it suboptimal as an adaptive template matcher.

Our simulator was designed from the ground up to be part of a GPU-accelerated adaptive template matcher. It uses both OpenGL and the general-purpose programming framework OpenCL; Two libraries that can inter-operate on the GPU. We describe it using a new notation system for homogeneous coordinates that allows complicated geometries to be expressed in a rigorous, unified and simple way. Its function is verified using data from Jesus Bay, Norway, recorded by the HISAS1030 100\,kHz SAS  mounted on a HUGIN AUV from Kongsberg Maritime.

%\begin{itemize}

%\item Improved classification performance by feeding simulator with parameters derived off SAS image,
%\item Further improved classification by performing a fine-search within a narrow search space around the SAS derived parameters. GPU makes this more powerful.
%\end{itemize}

% This is achieved with the aid of the massive computing power in graphics processing units (GPUs) and optimized software libraries for scene rendering. The simulator loads a 3D model of the seafloor and object class into OpenGL and positions the camera at the sonar location. The scene is highlighted using a light tube that extends to infinity along the AUV's axis of probagation. We assume rough, isotropic surfaces reflecting sound energy equally in all directions. This can be modeled with a Lambertian scattering model~\cite{Blake1993,Bell1995}, where the intensity of the backscattered sound solely depends on the incidence angle of the transmitted signal onto the model surface. The OpenGL rendering produces an optical 2D intensity image and depth map that reveals the distance from each pixel to the propagation axis. For maximum flexibility this data is finally combined with OpenCL to produce the image templates.

%Orthographic (projective) projection - parallel projection with the rays being perpendicular to the image plane.

%Simulating images of an active 100\,kHz SAS system share many traits to simulating optical images. Setting up the 3 dimensional scene is common to both, with the need to load various object models and setting up their interdependencies. Highlighting a region in the scene with acoustic energy can be modeled with a directional light source of equal beam width. Reflection models of light can be used too, since at 100\,kHz the acoustic waves mainly bounce off objects at their surface instead of penetrating them, and diffraction plays only a minor role. Finally, the resolution of modern SAS systems extend into the centimeter range in either direction. Combined these similarities can make it hard for an untrained eye to differentiate between a SAS and optical image.
%
%The big difference lies in what data is collected. A camera image represent a two-dimensional projection of a region of the scene onto an image plane. A sonar image, on the other hand, represent data from one fixed spatial dimension and range.

OpenGL is a popular, well-matured and multi-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. It relieves us from the intricacies of projecting vertices, faces and textures defined in a 3D space onto a suitable 2D image plane. This section explains how we set up OpenGL for this task, and then proceeds to describe how we post process the OpenGL images with OpenCL to form the final sonar image.

%Computer graphics

%A common pitfall in computer graphics is to define geometries in terms of coordinates. 


%One of the most challenging aspects of computer graphics is dealing with geometries. We often need 3D models with different coordinate systems, where the vertices can represent either facets or quads, and their order and normals affect visibility (culling) and lighting. When smaller objects constitute bigger ones, they need geometrical interdependencies, applied such that the constituent's intrinsic properties remain intact and edible. Several cameras may be placed in the scene, but acting on these lead to an opposite effect in the scene; a camera moving right corresponds to the scene moving left. Finally, one need to decide how points in the scene are projected onto the image plane, keeping track of depth scaling, coordinate normalization and clipping. For games and animation timing also play a key role, with synchronization and interpolation challenges related to displaying the image on a screen. Yet, we have not touched advanced topics such as modeling realistic mechanics, materials, particles, or lighting---all requiring a strict grip on the scene's geometry.\todo{Too verbose}
%
%{\color{blue}Cherie: Bit wordy here as well... The point I just need to make is that computer graphics has complex geometrical dependencies, and to deal with these best one should work on a level of abstraction that doesn't involve dealing with coordinates whenever possible.}
%
%Traditional computer graphics literature express these geometrical relationships in terms of a model, view and perspective matrix---$\mat{M}$, $\mat{V}$ and $\mat{P}$, respectively. $\mat{M}$ is unique to each 3D model, and describes its placement in the scene. $\mat{V}$ represents the camera or observer, and describes how the scene moves when viewed differently. Finally, $\mat{P}$ describes how points visible to the camera projects onto a viewing plane\todo{A bit of overlap here with former paragraph. Perhaps drop this paragraph}. This is conceptually a good starting point, but provides no aid in defining the aforementioned complex effects.\todo{Too vague}

\Fig{IV_buildup} illustrates the basic idea behind the simulator: to use OpenGL to render an intensity and depth image of an object and seafloor model, and OpenCL to convert these into an image template. The input parameters can either be predefined or estimated from the SAS image, which we label the conventional or adaptive approach, respectively.

\Fig{IV_simulator_coordinate_system} and \Tab{IV_tab_frames_transitions} details the geometry and processing steps that will underpin most of the upcoming implementation details. We adhere to a rigorous navigational notation system and rule set developed by K.~Gade~\cite{Gade2018}, extend it past affine geometry to handle homogeneous coordinates and projective geometry, and even use it when expressing non-linear effects. This permits expressing all kinds of both affine and projective operations as a single matrix multiplication, to raise the abstraction level to that of the frames.

We describe the transformations that a vertex $\udot{V}$ undergoes, from being represented in the model $\ubar{M}$, to  image $\ubar{I}$, sonar $\ubar{S}$, a orthogonal and cylindric viewing plane, $\ubar{O}$ and $\ubar{C}$ respectively, and a clipping space $\ubar{X}$ (not shown in \Fig{IV_simulator_coordinate_system}).   These, and the transitions between them, will be described in greater detail.

%To showcase the advantage of using our notation system, observe from \Fig{IV_simulator_coordinate_system} which reference frames we decomposed the virtual scene into: A 3D model $\ubar{M}$, image region $\ubar{I}$, sonar local body $\ubar{S}$, and an orthogonal and cylindric viewing plane, $\ubar{O}$ and $\ubar{C}$, respectively.

%About half the time developing the simulator was spent dealing with the (slightly simplified) geometries illustrated in \Fig{IV_simulator_coordinate_system}; It was far too easy to get lost when compounding transforms, thinking in terms of coordinates rater than vectors, and when dealing with various corner-cases.\todo{Too verbal} However, this was later rectified by adopting and extending the stringent and unified notation system developed by Gade~\cite{Gade2018}. We present a subset of his (simplified) notation here, before extending it to homogeneous coordinates and projective spaces---which are a better fit to computer graphics.



%Reference frames, transitions between them. Leads to uniform process.

% Coordinate based approach
% - Heavy use of matrices to describe geometric operations
% - Multiplication with [2,0;0,1] might mean: Changed coordinate system but same geometry, same coordinate system but changed geometry, a map from one domain to another, or it may have no geometric interpretation at all.
% Without keeping track of coordinate system/spaces, it's easy and common to make mistakes. In particular, to perform geometrically meaningless operations such as combining points or vectors from different spaces.

% Coordinate-free
% - Address problem of ambiguity and validity by sticking to geometric reasoning.
% - Geometric objects implementation pixar reference. Ensures that only valid geometrical operations are performed.

% Affine spaces
% - More general foundation for Euclidean space. Points have the single attribute position, while free vectors have a direction and magnitude.
% - Subtraction axiom:
%   v = P-Q     for every P,Q     (no "points at infinity")
%   P-Q = v     for every Q,v     (no "holes" in the space)
% - Head-to-tail-axiom
%   (P-Q)+(Q-R) = P-R
%
% Claims:
% Q-Q = 0 (vector)
% R-Q = -(Q-R)
% v+(Q-R) = (v+Q)-R
% P = Q + (P-Q)
% (Q+v)-(R+w) = (Q-R)-(v-w)

%Geometrical objects: Points. Vectors act on points. Rotation matrices act on vectors.

%The transformation of a rigid body in Euclidean space is uniquely defined by a translation and a rotation. 

%Rigid objects. Cloud of points with fixed distances between them. Transform that preserve this property comprised of translation of origins, plus a rotation of bases. Abstract away these and coordinate-specific details. Only talk about transforms.


%Notation categories: With and without coordinates. First, coordinate-free. Pure geometrical reasoning, geometrical elements and associated operations, higher abstraction, conceptually clear, close relation to physical reality. Then, represent geometrical objects with coordinates. Ambiguities and numerical side effects easier to handle with a firm grasp of geometric reasoning.


Gade's notation can be used with or without coordinates. We prefer the latter when emphasizing geometrical reasoning, conceptual clarity, or physical understanding. Coordinates are a practical necessity, but add complexity; manipulating them can be tricky and tedious, their interpretation ambiguous, and their construction error prone; strict discipline is needed to avoid constructing invalid geometrical operations, such as mixing coordinates from two different frames. The notation system unambiguously expresses geometrical meaning and validity, thus allowing the designer to focus on higher level concepts rather than getting lost in implementation details. 

\subsection{Free notation}\label{IV_sec:general_notation}

Suppose an $N$-dimensional rigid model $\mathcal{M}$ has a reference frame $\ubar{M} \triangleq (\udot{M},\uvec{M})$ attached to it, where $\udot{M}\in\mathbb{A}$ is its absolute position and $\uvec{M}\triangleq\big(\hat{x}_{M},\hat{y}_{M},\dots\big)\in\mathbb{V}^N$ its absolute orientation.
%
%
%
%The set of all possible configurations for the model is called its C-space, its dimension matching the number of degrees of freedom and its shape matching the topology. Rigid bodies have $N(N+1)/2$ degrees of freedom, $N$ Euclidean ones for position (topology $\mathbb{E}^N$), and $N(N-1)/2$ angular ones for orientation (topology $S^2S^1$ or $S^1$ for $N=\{3,2\}$, respectively).
%
%
A vertex $\udot{V}$ in the model can be related to the frame by a position vector $\vec{p}_{MV}\in\mathbb{V}$ going from $\udot{M}$ to $\udot{V}$,
%
\begin{align}
\vec{p}_{MV} &\triangleq \udot{V} - \udot{M},\label{eq_position_vector}
\end{align}
%
where $\vec{p}_{MV} = -\vec{p}_{V\!M}$. %According to the Chasles-Mozzi theorem, any rigid body displacement can be composed from a rotation and a translation. 
%
% To preserve model rigidity, all the model's vertex-vectors can only be together by a single affine operation; First a rotation (or more generally, a linear transformation) for changing its orientation, followed by a translation for changing its position.

We can write the configuration of $\vec{T}_{IM}$ as $\mathcal{C}_{IM}=(\vec{p}_{IM},\vec{R}_{IM})$.

The symbol $\times$, which denotes the cartesian product of sets, will be dropped and assumed implicit from now on. All frames and their configurations are listed in \Tab{IV_tab_frames_transitions}, along with an associated numeric representation. We describe this next.

%
\begin{align}\label{IV_eq_free_vector_addition}

= \vec{p}_{\g{I}{I}\r{M1}{M}}

    \draw[]                    ($ (V.south)  - (0em,\tpad) $)

            to[out=-90, in=0]     (_IV_IM);
    }
\end{align}
%
This vector addition (and any other vector-vector operation) is numerically possible and valid only if---and only if---all vectors are decomposed, or represented, in the same frame. Since position vectors have Euclidean topology, we may represent $\vec{p}$ in $\ubar{I}$ with a real number for each degree of freedom, $\dvec{p}^I\in\mathbb{R}^N$, and unambiguously rewrite \eq{IV_eq_free_vector_addition} in decomposed form as
%
\begin{align}
\dvec{p}_{IV}^{\Green{I}} &= \dvec{p}_{I\cancel{M}}^{\Green{I}} + \dvec{p}_{MV}^{\Green{I}}.\label{eq_head_tail_decomposed}
\end{align}
%
% Inverse $\dvec{R}^{-1} = \dvec{R}^T$\\
% Closure $\dvec{R}_1\dvec{R}_2 \in\mathrm{SO(3)}$\\
% Associative but not commutative
% 
% 
To obtain $\dvec{p}_{MV}^I$ we must rotate $\dvec{p}_{MV}^M$ by $\vec{R}_{IM}$. Since rotations have angular topology, we represent them in a space of more dimensions than the number of degrees of freedom, which avoids issues with rapidly changing values and singularities (e.g. Gimbal lock). A common choice is a rotation matrix $\dvec{R}\in\mathrm{SO}(N)$, i.e. a special (right handed) orthogonal $\mathbb{R}^{N\times{}N}$ matrix, with the properties $|\dvec{R}|=1$ (left-handed would be $-1$) and $\dvec{R}^T\dvec{R} = \dvec{I}$. The latter property constrains the column vectors of $\dvec{R}$ to be independent (orthogonal) and of unit length. This leaves $\dvec{R}$ with $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom, as desired. Thus, the representation of $\vec{R}_{IM}$ in $\uvec{I}$ is $\dvec{R}_{IM}^I = \dvec{R}_{IM}\in \mathrm{SO}(N)$, subject to $\uvec{M} \mapsto \uvec{I}$,
%

\end{align}
%
When $\dvec{R}_{IM}$ is left-multiplied as here, it should be interpreted as the \emph{orientation} of $\uvec{M}$ \emph{represented} in $\uvec{I}$, and \emph{vice versa} if it is right-multiplied.  %Embee
%, and the orthogonality follows from the skew symmetry of the axis of rotation. %SO$(N)$ are also known as rigid transformations, because they preserve the distance and orientation between points~\cite{Murray1994}\footnote{Pages 26-27}\todo{Valid page specification?}.
%
Note that $\dvec{R}_{IM} = \dvec{R}_{IM}^I = \dvec{R}_{IM}^M$ because $\dvec{p}_{MV}^M$ is rotated about a $\mathbb{R}^{N-2}$-subspace that is fixed in both $\ubar{I}$ and $\ubar{M}$. For the two- and three-dimensional case the rotations are about fixed points and lines, respectively.

The rotation in \eq{eq_passive_rotation} is called passive because its geometric intent is to change the representation but leave the absolute position of the point unchanged. An active transformation, by contrast, changes the vector but not the representation. A notational remark on this can be found in Appendix \ref{IV_active_rotations_transforms}, but only passive transformations will be needed henceforth.



\subsection{Homogeneous transformations}

Any transformation in $\mathbb{R}^N$-space can be represented by a transformation matrix $\dvec{T} \in \mathbb{R}^{N+1,N+1}$. In the affine case, it has the form of a special Euclidean matrix $\dvec{T}\in\mathrm{SE}(N)$,
%

\subsubsection{Model displacement $\dvec{T}_{\!IM}$}

We previously found that the representation of $\mathcal{C}_{IM}$ in $\uvec{I}$ can be written $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}_{IM}^I = (\dvec{p}_{IM}^I,\mat{R}_{IM})$. The transform that applies this configuration, $\vec{T}_{IM}\colon \ubar{M}\to\ubar{I}$, can be represented by a transformation matrix $\dvec{T}_{IM} \in \mathbb{R}^{N+1,N+1}$,
%
\begin{align}
\dvec{T}_{IM} &= 
\left[\begin{array}{c c}
 \mat{R}_{IM}  & \dvec{p}_{IM}^I \\%\hline
 \dvec{0}^T  &  s^{-1}
\end{array}\right] \nn &\in
\begin{cases}
\mathrm{SE}(N) & \mathrm{when}\ s=1,\\
\mathrm{Sim}(N) & \mathrm{otherwise},
\end{cases} \label{eq_homogeneous_transformation}
\end{align}
%
where $\dvec{0}^T$ is a row zero-vector of length $N$ and $s$ is a scaling factor. 

Its usage is similar to that of the rotation matrix, except that it requires a homogeneous coordinate $[w\dvec{p}_{D\cdot}^E;w]\T\in\mathbb{P}$ as input, where $w\in\mathbb{R}$ (typically 1),
%
\begin{align}
\dvec{p}_{IV}^I &= \mat{T}_{IM}\; 
\left[\begin{array}{c}\dvec{p}_{MV}^M \\ 1
\end{array}\right].
\end{align}
%
When $\mat{T}_{IM}$ is left-multiplied as here, it should be interpreted as the \emph{displacement} of $\ubar{M}$ \emph{represented} in $\ubar{I}$, and \emph{vice versa} if it is right-multiplied. This is analogous to the rotation matrix. 

% Analogous to rotation matrices it is associative but not commutative, and closed under . 

% Note that (\ref{eq:T_definition}) requires an  This is a homogeneous coordinate with an associated projective space. The value of $w$ controls the translation in (\ref{eq:T_definition}): $w=1$ enables it while $w=0$ disables it. This is handy because it allows specifying whether a coordinate represent a movable point or position vector, or a fixed direction vector\todo{Never actually seen this, hard to imagine a practical use case.}, by setting $w$ to either 1 or 0. Homogeneous coordinates and projective spaces allow dealing with these in a uniform manner.


\subsubsection{Camera displacement $\dvec{T}_{\!IM}$}

The image region can have any position and orientation relative to the sonar, so the configuration $\mathcal{C}_{SI}$ has six degrees of freedom. This is identical to $\mathcal{C}_{IM}$ except for the lack of a scaling factor. We represent the displacement $\vec{T}_{SI}$ in $\uvec{S}$ as,
%
\begin{align}
\dvec{T}_{SI}&\in\mathrm{SE(3)} \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3,
\intertext{which depends on the translation $\vec{p}_{SI}$ in $\uvec{S}$,}
\dvec{p}_{SI}^S &= [x,y,z]^T\in \mathbb{R}^3,
\intertext{and the rotation $\vec{R}_{SI}$ in $\uvec{S}$,}
\dvec{R}_{SI} &= \dvec{R}_{\mathrm{Euler}}(\psi,\theta,\phi)\nn
              &\in\mathrm{SO(3)} \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3.

%\intertext{and combine these together into the displacement $\vec{T}_{IM}$ in $\uvec{I}$,}
%\dvec{T}_{IM}&\in\mathrm{Sim(3)} \colon \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}^4
%\end{align}
%
%
%
We can write the configuration of $\vec{T}_{IM}$ as $\mathcal{C}_{IM}=(\vec{p}_{IM},\vec{R}_{IM})$.

\begin{align}
\dvec{p}_{IM}^I&\in \mathbb{R}^3 \\
\dvec{R}_{IM}&\in\mathrm{SO(3)} \colon \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3 \\
\dvec{T}_{IM}&\in\mathrm{Sim(3)} \colon \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}^4
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\dvec{T}_{IM} &= 
\left[\begin{array}{c c}

Because other linear operations are sometimes needed, such as scaling, reflection and shearing, we may generalize \eq{eq_rotation_translation} by swapping $\dvec{R}_{IM}$ with $\dvec{L}_{IM}$. 

As we proceed, the steps outlined in \Fig{IV_simulator_coordinate_system} will now receive a corresponding subheader in the text.

Like the These preserve points, straight lines and planes, and ensure collinearity (parallel lines remain parallel).

%\end{cases}
%= \mat{R}_{AB}\;\mat{S}_{AB}      = \dvec{p}_{AB}^A
where $\mat{L}_{AB}: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ and $\dvec{t}_{AB}^A$ represent the linear map and translation from $\udot{B}$ to $\udot{A}$, respectively.




%Rotations fall into the category of linear transforms. If the model size was incorrect we seek another linear transform: scaling. To generalize  Often we also want other candidates from this category, such as scaling, reflection or shearing. 

%To change the decomposition we multiply with some linear transform $\mat{L}\colon\mathbb{R}^3\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^3$. Gade restricts these to rotation matrices, which preserve lengths and cross-products---a prerequisite for rigid body transformations~\cite{Murray1994}. Computer graphics deal with this extensively, but not exclusively; Linear effects such as scaling, shear and reflection are sometimes needed.

%Since linear transforms generally are non-commutative, the notation system specifies the proper sequence of multiplication in the subscripts of $\mat{L}_{ED}$; Vectors or other linear transformation matrices decomposed in $\uvec{D}$ go to the right, while those in $\uvec{E}$ go to the left.\todo{$\mat{R}_{ED} = \mat{R}_{DE}^T$ (usually)} Note that representing the vector differently does not change it; its direction and magnitude remains unchanged.

%Vector-vector operations like summation, dot- and cross-product, only makes sense when the vectors are decomposed in the same vector space---easily verified by the superscripts. The subscripts explain how the vector is altered: The intermediate (closest) frames cancel each other, leaving the start and end frame as subscript for the resulting vector. This mimics the regular rules of vector addition.

\subsubsection{Model placement}

When the 3D models of seafloor and object are loaded into OpenGL they each have with their own reference frame $\protect\ubar{M}$. To position and orient the models into the image frame $\protect\ubar{I}$, we apply the \emph{model matrix} $\mat{T}_\textit{\tiny\!IM}$.

\subsubsection{Camera/sonar setup}

To determine what parts of the scene the sonar can see, we place the OpenGL camera at the origin of the sonar frame, $\protect\udot{S}$, pointing at the origin of the image frame, $\protect\udot{I}$. This is achieved with the \emph{sonar (view) matrix} $\mat{T}_\textit{\tiny\!SI}$.

\subsubsection{Orthographic projection}

With the scene and camera set up, the next step is compute how visible points in the scene project onto the viewing plane spanned by $x$ and $\varphi$ in $\ubar{C}$. The size of this plane is determined by the desired image region on the seafloor. The projection is performed with the \emph{projection matrix} $\mat{T}_\textit{\tiny\!PS}$.

\subsubsection{OpenGL rendering}

When OpenGL renders the scene it uses a \emph{vertex shader} to apply the model, sonar and perspective matrices to each vertex, and a \emph{fragment shader} to compute the intensity values for each point in the image. We also make OpenGL compute the range from each image pixel to its corresponding model facet: This is called a \emph{depth map}.

\subsubsection{OpenCL post-processing}

Finally, the sonar-like image is formed---for some unique azimuth coordinate---by accumulating all intensity values that share the same range. This is our template. %  along with the depth information is finally combined to form a sonar like image. This is our template.


%To get an idea of the geometries involved we refer to \Fig{IV_simulator_coordinate_system}. 

%Our models are stored in regular 3D model files. The simulator loads these into a tree of nodes, each representing a vertex in the model with corresponding facet and texture information. Then the vertices are placed into a virtual scene in OpenGL, and a camera set up to capture the part of the scene corresponding to the image. When OpenGL renders the image, it first computes which vertex contributes to which pixel in the image, then computes the intensity and color of the pixel based on the node's facet, texture and scattering model. In computer graphics terminology, the code that operates on vertices are called a vertex shader, and the code that operates on pixels are called a fragment shader.

%Before we describe the rendering pipeline in further detail, 

%In computer graphics 
%Contrary to many computer graphics applications, we 



\subsubsection{Normalization and clipping}

OpenGL clips any coordinate that end up outside the normalized range $[-1,1]$. This means that we need to offset and normalize each axis such that the pixels we want visible end up in this range.
Defining $\udot{I}_{\hat{x}\hat{y}}$ as the point $I(\min,\min,0)$ and $\udot{I}_{\check{x}\check{y}}$ as the point $I(\max,\max,0)$.\todo{Not sold on this syntax...}

Finally the relevant part of the scene is projected onto the image plane with a projection matrix $\P$. There are two main types of projection, perspective and orthographic. Perspective projection scales all $x$ and $y$ coordinates inversely with distance to create a sense of perspective in the image. Orthographic projection, in contrast, maps all the scene's vertices to a squared cube where each dimension has the range [-1,1]. This will render all objects equally large whether they are in the distance or up close. The matrix that gives orthographic projection is defined as
%
\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\\\dvec{p}_{XV}^{X}\\\\\hline 1

\subsection{OpenGL rendering}

To produce the sonar templates we assume a rough, isotropic surface that reflects energy equally in all directions. This permits us to use a Lambertian scattering model where the backscatter intensity depends only on the incidence angle~\cite{Zhang1999}. It does not consider observation angle or sound frequency, but for the purpose of creating templates this is not needed.   

The rendered image will appear as if we placed a window at the sonar and looked through it in the direction of the image. This window is resized to make sure that the template image perfectly fills it.



\subsection{OpenCL post-processing}

The ``camera image'' rendered with OpenGL is not in along-track and cross-track coordinates as we want it to be. It does, however, show us what parts of the scene that are visible from the sonar. OpenGL can also produce a depth map that reveals the distance to each of image pixels. This information can be converted to a ranged sonar-like image by simply adding up all the intensity values that share the same depth for each range line. We perform this computation in OpenCL. It allows general purpose programming on GPUs and can interoperate with OpenGL quite nicely. This way we keep all the calculations on the GPU.

\begin{align}
&\text{forall } y,\varphi \nn
&\quad\text{if }\left\lfloor y_I\right\rfloor == y \nn
&\qquad\dvec{a}_I[y] \colon= \big(y_I - \left\lfloor y_I\right\rfloor\big)\dvec{a}^C[\varphi] \nn

%\subsection{Template matching}
%
%1. Segmentation
%2. Parameter estimation
%   Available: Range, altitude, resolution => Input to both standard and adaptive. In standard the best fit out of a predefined template database is selected, then resampled to correct resolution.
%   Additional for adaptive, parameters that modify object model: Target aspect angle, seafloor slope, object length and height.
%
%   Target aspect angle computed with Radon Transform, seafloor under object modeled as plane with a slope estimated from bathymetric data, length estimated from longest part of highlight region, and height estimated from the shape of the shadow. The burial depth is n
%
%
%   
%3. 
%
%   Details: \cite{Midelfart2010}.
%
%Let $S(x,y)$ be the isolated part of the
%
%Matching the isolated image segment with the template take the form of
%
%\begin{align}
%c_{h,i} = \underset{x',y'}{\text{argmax}} \sum\limits_{\forall x}\sum\limits_{\forall y} \big| H(x,y) - T(x-x',y-y') \big|
%\end{align}
%
%\begin{align}
%c_i = \frac{c_{h,i} + c_{s,i}}{2}
%\end{align}
%
%And the final template used is the one with the greatest correlation coefficient
%
%\begin{align}
%\underset{T_i(x,y)}{\text{argmax}} C_i\sum\limits_{\forall x}\sum\limits_{\forall y}  S(x,y) T(x-x',y-y')
%\end{align}
%
%Then assign object to class $i$.
%
%
%To narrow down the search space of possible templates we derive some reliable statistics of the seafloor and object from the SAS image. While FFISim accepts an arbitrarily complex seabed, we find that modeling it as a plane wave with the right tilt works well. The object is more difficult. For instance, we estimate its length and height from the shape of its shadow, but this fails if the object is notably immersed into the seabed at one end. 
%
%After the a template is created we decompose it into its highlight and shadow component, and compute a correlation score between these and the corresponding areas in the SAS image. Then the two scores are summed and normalized to form the final correlation score of the template.
%
%We tag the template matchers as either semi- or fully adaptive. The former refers to using the best matching SIGMAS+ generated template out of a precomputed set of templates, while the latter refers to the proposed method of using FFISim to generate templates on the-the-fly. \todo{Should be more precise. How many templates? Parameter span? How finely were the parameters sampled?} 

% It is also possible to compute the sonar image using the OpenGL ``blend'' feature.

\subsection{Speed considerations}

Using OpenGL and OpenGL to generate sonar templates on the GPU allow hundreds of sonar templates to be formed per second. While this is sufficient for our needs. However, initializing the OpenGL and OpenCL context and loading 3D models from file into it is a slow process, and typically takes several seconds for every invocation. Therefore, to alleviate the simulation performance we either had to supply it with a list of parameters or ensure that it did not have to be shut down for every invocation.

The upcoming results will be based on experimental data from a HISAS1030 interferometric synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) attached to a HUGIN autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), both developed by Kongsberg Maritime, Norway. The HISAS1030 is a fully digital phased array with 32 hydrophones, 100\,kHz center frequency and 30\,kHz bandwidth. It is 1.2\,m long, has a half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of 23$^\circ$, and is capable of generating SAS images with a theoretical resolution of 3-4\,cm both cross- and along-track. Our version of HUGIN also carries a camera that is used for optical inspection of interesting objects.

%To test performance of our simulator and template matching techniques where measured using experimental data from 

We present three different HUGIN runs from the Jesus Bay in Norway. The first two a couple days apart in January 2009, containing roughly 2700 and 3200 detections, respectively. The last is from June 2012 and contains roughly 650 detections. Almost all objects here are cylindric---e.g. barrels, pipe mines and torpedoes---with a length of about 3\,m.

The following three methods will be contrasted:\todo{Poor transition}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Standard (SIGMAS+).} Picks the best template out of a set precomputed with SIGMAS+. The templates are tailored to a 3\,m long cylinder; the most frequently occurring object in the scene.
\item \emph{Adaptive, normal (FFISim).} Creates a single template with FFISim, given estimated seafloor and object orientation, and object length, width and immersion depth~\cite{Midelfart2010}. 
\item \emph{Adaptive, buried (FFISim).} Finds an "optimal" template with FFISim, given the estimated parameters described above and a search space for burial depth---modeled as rotation by $\{-4,-2,0,2,4\}^\circ$ around the cross track axis $y_\textrm{\tiny$\uvec{I}$}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Processing speed}

%FFISim was designed to 
%The key selling point of FFISim is that it is very fast. 
%Note that FFISim 
%
%is used with the adaptive method due to its tighter integration with the classifier, allowing a range of templates to be generated and assessed on the GPU in a single invocation. It can produce thousands of templates per second if need be. This is why FFISim is being used in the adaptive procedure, and SIGMAS+ in the conventional procedure with a static precomputed set of templates.


Our GPU-based simulator is very fast. On a computer with a six-core Intel Core i7-3930K and a Radeon HD7970 it computes almost 1000 templates per second, each being 1 megapixel large. This makes it possible to tailor the templates very closely imaged objects. In contrast, in the standard approach a template library must be created beforehand from a limited set of parameter values. Hence, it may happen that no template in the library is a close fit of the object in the image even though the object actually is a target of interest.\todo{Rewrite paragraph}

%The edge of FFISim lies in its tighter integration with the classifier


\subsection{Classification - selected objects}


Let us first study simulation and classification performance on three typical objects from the 2012 data: Two roughly 3\,m long mines and a 5\,m long torpedo, each with unique immersion depth and aspect angle. We present the SAS image segments and templates for these objects in \Fig{IV_fig_images_sonar_simulation}, with hand-drawn red lines superimposed to mark the objects' contours. Observe the following:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Template image quality} is similar for both SIGMAS+ and FFISim. With accurate input parameters, both simulators generate highlight and shadow regions with correct size and shape. Intensity values are also near identical (ignoring background level), as expected since they both rely on a Lambertian scattering model.
\item \emph{Template accuracy} improves when using the adaptive technique; It excels at generating accurate highlight regions, but is less convincing in shadow regions. This advantage grows the more unconventional the object is, since these objects will not be represented in the static database.
\end{itemize}

%- Template quality FFISim/SIGMAS+, similar. Same size/shape.
%- Adaptive technique for highlight, tie for shadows. Same seen in segmentation result.
%- Speed -> FFISim


%Note how the adaptive technique excels at reproducing accurate highlights, but that this does not necessarily translate into accurate shadows. 

%In terms of template quality both SIGMAS+ and FFISim produce similar results. 

%\Fig{IV_fig_image_simulation} contrasts the segmentation result of the templates with that of the SAS image---in terms of highlight, shadow and background regions. As expected the adaptive technique generally produce better matching templates, but with a surprising caveat: Improved highlight scores did not necessarily translate to better shadow scores. 


%Out of the objects in the scene we selected a 2.6\;m long cylinder that was partly buried in the sea sediments (Fig. \ref{IV_data_cylinder}). The length, immersion depth and aspect angle of this cylinder were estimated from the SAS image using our  adaptive template matching approach~\cite{Midelfart2010}. 

%Then these parameters were used by the simulator to create an adaptive template (Fig. \ref{IV_sim_cylinder}), which is an almost perfect match of the cylinder. We also created standard templates for a regular template matching approach. In this case, we assumed that the cylinder mine had a generic length of 2\;m (like a MP80 or a Murena mine) and was proud on the seafloor. Moreover, templates were created for every 10$^\text{th}$ degree of the aspect angle. We believe these assumptions to be typical for a template library for cylinder mines. 

%Note how the adaptive template obtained a much closer fit to image than the standard template. This was also reflected in the correlation scores (which were created with the method described in \cite{Midelfart2010}) that were 0.613 for the standard template and 0.813 for the adaptive template. Hence, the standard approach was less likely to classify the cylinder in the image correctly as the standard templates were not created specifically for the target.

%The main difference lies in how they integrate into the classification process: While SIGMAS+ generate one template for each invocation, FFISim can iterate through a space of parameters on the GPU before returning control to the CPU. This speeds up the template matching dramatically, allowing it to assess thousands of templates per second instead of, say, one. 

% FFISim provide templates that better match the true object orientation in this figure, but  

% Different background level. Adaptive technique excels for less normal objects/geometries.
%Overlap - Provide quantification measure. 

\subsection{Classification - all objects}

We demonstrate classification performance with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in \Fig{IV_fig_roc_curves}. 

Below 20\% false positive rate (FPR) the adaptive techniques outperformed the static method in every run. This benefits e.g. mine counter measures (MCM) operations because out of 3000 detections only a few will be visually inspected up close.

Above 20\% FPR the results are less clear: The adaptive techniques performed similarly to the static method in 2012, but worse January 6. and better January 8. 2009---with 5 and 3 false detections at 20\% FPR, respectively. From visual inspection we found the cause to be a combination of fish trawler tracks and poor highlight and shadow quality.

\section{Conclusion}\label{IV_conclusion}

One way to automatically classify objects in SAS images is to compare the imaged objects with a predefined set of templates. However, this is suboptimal as it is infeasible to create accurate templates for all the relevant configurations of seabeds and objects. To solve this we have implemented a SAS simulator that creates the templates in delayed real-time based on parameters estimated from the current scene. In our studies this improves the match between the SAS objects and their corresponding template significantly in most cases.

To obtain the delayed real-time performance we implemented the simulator on a GPU. These devices have a theoretical peak performance that is typically an order of magnitude higher than CPUs in a comparable price range. We found this potential to be effectively utilized with the well matured and highly optimized OpenGL graphics processing API. Our simulator use this framework for most of the scene processing.

A final post-processing step is performed in OpenCL, which allow general purpose GPU programming. It interoperates well with OpenGL and adds a lot of flexibility to the simulation process. This is valuable as the simulator is still being actively developed and will likely see new features that can not be easily implemented in OpenGL alone.

With good image quality or low FRP, or both, the adaptive methods did better. However, when this was not the case, it was less clear who the winner was. The standard method of using a static template library generally did well here, . 

In terms of template quality both SIGMAS+ and FFISim are similar. The main difference lies in how they integrate into the classification process: While SIGMAS+ generate one template for each invocation, FFISim can iterate through a space of parameters on the GPU before returning control to the CPU. This speeds up the template matching dramatically, allowing it to assess thousands of templates per second instead of, say, one.

\section{Active rotations and transforms}\label{IV_active_rotations_transforms} 

The geometrical intent of an active rotation is to move a point. With our notation this can be expressed as either
%
\begin{align}
\m{CL}
\vec{p}_{M\g{Vtot}{V}_{\color{Green}\!\textrm{new}}}
= \vec{R} \; \vec{p}_{M\g{V2}{V}}\m{CR}
\quad\text{or}\quad
\m{CL2}
\dvec{p}_{M\g{Vtot2}{V}_{\color{Green}\!\textrm{new}}}^M
= \mat{R}^M \dvec{p}_{M\g{V4}{V}}^M,\m{CR2}

Beware that the rotation matrix can be identical---both notationally and numerically---in the active and passive case, say, if $\dvec{R}^M$ was replaced by $\dvec{R}_{IM}$ in \eq{IV_eq_active_rotation}. Thus, the geometrical intent must be inferred from the position vector notation; Either the point changes, or the representation does, but never both.

\vec{R}_{IM}\colon \uvec{M} &\to \uvec{I}\label{eq_rotation_dyadic}\\
\vec{M}_i &\mapsto \vec{I}_i \quad \forall i. \nonumber
\end{align}

We define $\vec{R}_{AB}$ as a rotation---from $\uvec{A}$ to $\uvec{B}$---by angle $\theta\in\mathbb{R}$ clockwise around unit vector $\hat{r}\in\mathbb{V}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ Euclidean space using Euler-Rodrigues' formula,

%
\begin{align}

and the angle $\theta$ and rotation axis $\hat{r}_{AB}$ can be expressed in terms of $\vec{p}_A$ and $\vec{p}_{B}$,
%
\begin{align}
\theta
&= \mathrm{acos}\frac{\vec{p}_{A}\cdot\vec{p}_{B}}{\lVert\vec{p}_{A}\rVert\lVert\vec{p}_{B}\rVert} \\
\hat{r}_{AB} &=  \frac{\vec{p}_{A}\times\vec{p}_{B}}{\lVert\vec{p}_{A}\rVert\lVert\vec{p}_{B}\rVert}
\end{align}

$SO(3)$ refers to special (\emph{i.e.} right handed) orthogonal $\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$ matrices, where the handedness is verified by determinant $\big|R\big|=1$ (as opposed to $\pm1$), and the orthogonality follows from the skew symmetry of $\overset{\times}{r}_{AB}$. $SO(3)$ are also known as rigid transformations, because they preserve the distance and orientation between points~\cite{Murray1994}\footnote{Pages 26-27}\todo{Valid page specification?}.

{\color{blue}Below is the old text}

We restrict our attention to linear transforms of the kind $\mat{L}_{AB} = \mat{R}_{AB}\;\mat{S}_{AB}$ where the former is a rotation matrix and the latter a scaling matrix. The rotations are performed with Euler-Rodrigues formula~\cite{Dai2015} using a unit length rotation axis $\dvec{\hat{r}}_{AB}^A$ and angle $\theta_{AB}$:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:M}
\mat{R}_{AB} &= \I + \sin\theta_{AB}\;[\dvec{\hat{r}}^A\times] + (1-\cos\theta_{AB})\;[\dvec{\hat{r}}^A\times]^2 \in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}
\end{align}
%
where $\big[\dvec{\hat{r}}_{AB}^A\big]$ is the open-right cross product matrix of $\dvec{\hat{r}}^A$ and $\mat{I}$ is the identity matrix. 

% %\dvec{\hat{p}}_{A\times{}B}^C
\begin{align}
\theta_{AB}
&= \mathrm{acos}\frac{\dvec{p}_{A}^{C}\cdot\dvec{p}_{B}^{C}}{\lVert\dvec{p}_{A}^{C}\rVert\lVert\dvec{p}_{A}^{C}\rVert} \\
\dvec{\hat{r}}_{AB}^C &=  \frac{\dvec{p}_{A}^{C}\times\dvec{p}_{B}^{C}}{\lVert\dvec{p}_{A}^{C}\rVert\lVert\dvec{p}_{A}^{C}\rVert}

Each data model that we load into OpenGL is defined in its own local coordinate system. To map them into OpenGL world coordinates a set of common transformation matrices are applied to each model's vertices:
%
\begin{align}
\bmat{x_t \\ y_t \\ z_t \\ w}_\text{\parbox{1cm}{\setlength\baselineskip{0.3cm}transformed\\model}} &= \boldsymbol{T} \cdot \boldsymbol{R} \cdot \boldsymbol{S} \cdot \bmat{x \\ y \\ z \\ w}_\text{model}.
\end{align}
%
Here a model vertex at position $(x,y,z)$ is first scaled with $\boldsymbol{S}$, then rotated with $\boldsymbol{R}$ and finally translated with $\boldsymbol{T}$, resulting in the transformed coordinates $(x_t,y_t,z_t)$. The parameter $w$ defines whether the vertex is a position ($w=1$) or a direction ($w=0$), which need to be handled differently. While these matrices are well-known in the field of computer graphics, there exist several different conventions but we supply them here for completeness.

%Adding some phantom space to align the columns of the next matrices
\newcommand\pc[1]{\phantom{ml}#1\phantom{ml}}
The scaling and translation matrices are simple:
%
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{S}(\s) &= \bmat{
   s_x  &  0   & 0  & 0 \\
   0    &  s_y  &  0    &  0 \\
   0    &  0    &  s_z  &  0 \\
   \pc{0}    &  \pc{0}    &  \pc{0}    & \pc{1} \\
  },
  \end{align}
%
and
%
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{T(\vec\Delta}) &= \bmat{
	1  &  0  &  0  &  \Delta_x \\
	0  &  1  &  0  &  \Delta_y \\
	0  &  0  &  1  &  \Delta_z \\
 \pc{0}  &   \pc{0}  &   \pc{0}  &   \pc{1} \\
},
\end{align}
%
where $\s = (s_x, s_y, s_z)$ and $\vec\Delta = (\Delta_x, \Delta_y, \Delta_z)$ are the scaling and translation factors.

Rotations will be specified using yaw ($\phi$), pitch ($\theta$) and roll ($\psi$), representing clockwise rotations around the intrinsic $z$-, $y$- and $x$-axis, respectively. Rotation order follow the intrinsic Tait-Brian $Z$-$Y'$-$X''$ convention, in which roll is applied first, then pitch and finally yaw:
%
\begin{align}
\R(\phi_x) = \R_z(\phi)\R_y(\theta)\R_x(\psi),
\end{align}
%
where
%
\begin{align}
\R_x(\psi) &= \bmat{
    1  &   0        &  0         &  0 \\
    0  &  \cos\psi  &  -\sin\psi &  0 \\
    0  &  \sin\psi  &  \cos\psi  &  0 \\
\pc{0} &  \pc{0}    &  \pc{0}    &  \pc{1} \\
}, \\[.5\baselineskip]
\R_y(\theta) & = \bmat{
\cos\theta	& 0          & \sin\theta & 0 \\
0				& 1          & 0          & 0  \\
-\sin\theta & 0          & \cos\theta & 0  \\
\pc{0}      &  \pc{0}    & \pc{0}     & \pc{1} \\
},
%\\[0\baselineskip]
\intertext{and}
%\\[0\baselineskip]
\R_z(\phi) &= \bmat{
\cos\phi	&  -\sin\phi   &  0      &  0 \\
\sin\phi	&  \cos\phi    &  0      &  0 \\
0			&  0           &  1      &  0 \\
\pc{0}	&  \pc{0}      &  \pc{0} &  \pc{1} \\
}.
\end{align}
%
Note that at $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$ we have $\phi=-\psi$, and at $\theta=-\frac{\pi}{2}$ we have $\phi=\psi$. This effect, in which one degree of freedom is lost, is known as Gimbal lock. Any three-parameter specification of an orientation in three-dimensional space has this problem. Adding a fourth parameter can resolve the issue. e.g. by direct specification of orientation in terms of a rotation axis and angle. This can be achieved using the Euler-Rodrigues formula or with quaternions. The latter has the added benefit of reduced computational complexity, improved numerical stability and simple ways to perform spherical interpolations. An alternative used extensively at FFI that is non-singular and practical is the $\vec n$-vector notation~\cite{Gade2010}. However, we stick with the Euler-angle representation here due to their simplicity.

%The position vector $\vec{p}_{\udot{A}\udot{B}}$ go from $\udot{A}$ to $\udot{B}$ only depends on these points. Similarly, the matrix $\vec{R}_{\uvec{A}\uvec{B}}$ only depends on vectors; $\vec{R}_{\uvec{A}\uvec{B}}\uvec{B}$ rotates $\uvec{B}$ to $\uvec{B}$, $\uvec{A}\vec{R}_{\uvec{A}\uvec{B}}$ rotates $\uvec{A}$ to $\uvec{B}$.
