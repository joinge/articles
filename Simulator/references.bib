abstract = {Mainly when applied in the underwater environment, sonar simulation requires great computational effort due to the complexity of acoustic physics. Simulation of sonar operation allows evaluating algorithms and control systems without going to the real underwater environment; that reduces the costs and risks of in-field experiments. This paper tackles with the problem of real-time underwater imaging sonar simulation by using the OpenGL shading language chain on GPU. Our proposed system is able to simulate two main types of acoustic devices: mechanical scanning imaging sonars and forward-looking sonars. The underwater scenario simulation is performed based on three frameworks: (i) OpenSceneGraph reproduces the ocean visual effects, (ii) Gazebo deals with physical forces, and (iii) the Robot Construction Kit controls the sonar in underwater environments. Our system exploits the rasterization pipeline in order to simulate the sonar devices, which are simulated by means of three parameters: the pulse distance, the echo intensity and the sonar field-of-view, being all calculated over observable objects shapes in the 3D rendered scene. Sonar-intrinsic operational parameters, speckle noise and object material properties are also considered as part of the acoustic image. Our evaluation demonstrated that the proposed system is able to operate close to or faster than the real-world devices. Also, our method generates visually realistic sonar images when compared with real-world sonar images of the same scenes.},

abstract = {We present an evaluation of the impact of a recently proposed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging technique on feature enhancement and automatic target recognition (ATR) performance. This image formation technique is based on nonquadratic optimization, and the images it produces appear to exhibit enhanced features. We quantify such feature enhancement through a number of criteria. The findings of our analysis indicate that the new feature-enhanced SAR image formation method provides images with higher resolution of scatterers, and better separability of different regions as compared with conventional SAR images. We also provide an ATR-based evaluation. We run recognition experiments using conventional and feature-enhanced SAR images of military targets, with three different classifiers. The first classifier is template based. The second classifier makes a decision through a likelihood test, based on Gaussian models for reflectivities. The third classifier is based on extracted locations of the dominant target scatterers. The experimental results demonstrate that the new feature-enhanced SAR imaging method can improve the recognition performance, especially in scenarios involving reduced data quality or quantity.},

@article{Elston2004,
abstract = {The pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method is an accurate and efficient scheme for solving the acoustic wave equation numerically. It provides a good basis for a general sonar simulation model because all of the fundamental processes on which sonar depend occur as natural consequences of solving the wave equation. Propagation, interference, and spreading and absorption losses are intrinsic to this solution; reflection and scattering are governed by the distribution of materials within the simulated environment. These processes are analogous to those in the physical system being modeled. The method generates the full spatial and temporal evolution of the acoustic field for a specified model environment. This paper presents the application of a PSTD model to the simulation of a sidescan sonar system operating in deep water. Synthetic sidescan images of sand ripples are simulated using a directional fractal surface as the model sea bed. Different forms of time-varying gain are applied to the received signals to investigate its effects on the statistics of the resulting images. These images are visually realistic and have significantly non-Rayleigh histograms. Rayleigh distribution, Rayleigh mixtures with up to four modes, and K distribution fits to these histograms demonstrate that the form of the applied time-varying gain has a substantial effect both on the derived distribution parameters and on the probability that the data are drawn from that distribution. They also demonstrate that, with a greater chi-square test probability and with fewer fitting parameters, the K distribution provides the more appropriate description of the reverberation from the simulated sand-ripple sea bed generated with the model sonar system. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

@article{Fei2015,
abstract = {This paper deals with several original contributions to an automatic target recognition (ATR) system, which is applied to underwater mine classification. The contributions concentrate on feature selection and object classification. First, a sophisticated filter method is designed for the feature selection. This filter method utilizes a novel feature relevance measure, the composite relevance measure (CRM). Feature relevance measures in the literature (e.g., mutual information and relief weight) evaluate the features only with respect to certain aspects. The CRM is a combination of several measures so that it is able to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the features. Both linear and nonlinear combinations of these measures are taken into account. A wide range of classifiers is able to provide satisfactory classification results by using the features selected according to the CRM. Second, in the step of object classification, an ensemble learning scheme in the framework of the Dempster-Shafer theory is introduced to fuse the results obtained by different classifiers. This fusion can improve the classification performance. We propose a reasonable construction of the basic belief assignment (BBA). The BBA considers both the reliability of the classifiers and the support of individual classifiers provided to the hypotheses about the types of test objects. Finally, this ATR system is applied to real synthetic aperture sonar imagery to evaluate its performance.},

abstract = {Modern sidescan sonars provide the ability to image the seafloor with increasingly high resolution. With this comes a corresponding increase in complexity of determining the performance of the sensor, with focus shifting from simple signal detection theory to assess the capability for automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms to discriminate between different objects based on the shape of the projected acoustic shadows on the seafloor. This paper uses information theory to place bounds on the performance of ATR algorithms which use features based on an object's shadow as a classification cue. Information is used to compute different bounds on the performance of any classification method. The technique is applied to a simple classification task namely to discriminate between circular and square shapes. The effect of sensor characteristics, such as contrast and resolution, are computed. An example is given where the bounds on performance for a sidescan sonar with given characteristics under some environmental conditions are computed. The performance is then analysed as a function of the shapes being classified by changing the circular shape to a superellipse. Although high-frequency imaging sonar is examined here, the method could be applied to other types of monochromatic imagery that contains multiplicative noise. {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007.},

Motivated by the high-resolution achievable by modern imaging sonars, a novel template matching technique is developed that compares a target signature generated from a simple acoustic model with the actual image of an object being classified. The approach uses both the correlation with target echoes as well as projected acoustic shadow, and is tested on data obtained from a synthetic aperture sonar during experiments at sea. It is compared to two commonly used methods that are based on normalized cross-correlation, and results show that the proposed method outperforms the standard methods in terms of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as confusion matrices. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

A standard solution is to perform image segmentation first (we obtain binary from graylevel image giving the label zero for pixels belonging to the shadow and the label one elsewhere), and then to perform a classification based on features extracted from the 2D-shape of the segmented shadow. Consequently, if a mistake happens during the process, it will be propagated through the following steps. In this paper, to avoid such drawbacks, we propose a novel approach where a dynamic segmentation scheme is fully classification-oriented. Actually, classification is performed directly from the raw image data. The approach is based on the combination of deformable models, genetic algorithms, and statistical image models. {\textcopyright} 2000 IEEE.},

@article{Reed2004,
abstract = {This paper presents a model-based approach to mine detection and classification by use of sidescan sonar. Advances in autonomous underwater vehicle technology have increased the interest in automatic target recognition systems in an effort to automate a process that is currently carried out by a human operator. Current automated systems generally require training and thus produce poor results when the test data set is different from the training set. This has led to research into unsupervised systems, which are able to cope with the large variability in conditions and terrains seen in sidescan imagery. The system presented in this paper first detects possible minelike objects using a Markov random field model, which operates well on noisy images, such as sidescan, and allows a priori information to be included through the use of priors. The highlight and shadow regions of the object are then extracted with a cooperating statistical snake, which assumes these regions are statistically separate from the background. Finally, a classification decision is made using Dempster-Shafer theory, where the extracted features are compared with synthetic realizations generated with a sidescan sonar simulator model. Results for the entire process are shown on real sidescan sonar data. Similarities between the sidescan sonar and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging processes ensure that the approach outlined here could be made applied to SAR image analysis. {\textcopyright} 2004 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {This paper describes the functional theory and design of a modular simulator to generate, in real-time, physically representative spatio-temporal sidescan sonar echo data. The seafloor topography Is generated using fractal theory and the resulting terrain is tesselated into triangular facets. Propagation of the acoustic fan beam is determined by a ray theory solution of the governing wave equation while the contribution of each facet to the recorded intensity at the sonar transducer is resolved by applying Jackson's seafloor scattering model. The computational bottleneck inherent in the discovery of illuminated facets at each ping is significantly reduced by the implementation of an optimised mesh refinement scheme intended for interactive rendering of large-scale complex surfaces described by polygonal meshes. The resulting performance increases enabled the successful integration of the sonar simulator with an existing AUV simulator. Synthetic images and the performance measures of the sidescan simulator image generation are presented. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},
