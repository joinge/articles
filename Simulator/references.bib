abstract = {This paper reviews the Euler–Rodrigues formula in the axis–angle representation of rotations, studies its variations and derivations in different mathematical forms as vectors, quaternions and Lie groups and investigates their intrinsic connections. The Euler–Rodrigues formula in the Taylor series expansion is presented and its use as an exponential map of Lie algebras is discussed particularly with a non-normalized vector. The connection between Euler–Rodrigues parameters and the Euler–Rodrigues formula is then demonstrated through quaternion conjugation and the equivalence between quaternion conjugation and an adjoint action of the Lie group is subsequently presented. The paper provides a rich reference for the Euler–Rodrigues formula, the variations and their connections and for their use in rigid body kinematics, dynamics and computer graphics.},

abstract = {Modern sidescan sonars provide the ability to image the seafloor with increasingly high resolution. With this comes a corresponding increase in complexity of determining the performance of the sensor, with focus shifting from simple signal detection theory to assess the capability for automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms to discriminate between different objects based on the shape of the projected acoustic shadows on the seafloor. This paper uses information theory to place bounds on the performance of ATR algorithms which use features based on an object's shadow as a classification cue. Information is used to compute different bounds on the performance of any classification method. The technique is applied to a simple classification task namely to discriminate between circular and square shapes. The effect of sensor characteristics, such as contrast and resolution, are computed. An example is given where the bounds on performance for a sidescan sonar with given characteristics under some environmental conditions are computed. The performance is then analysed as a function of the shapes being classified by changing the circular shape to a superellipse. Although high-frequency imaging sonar is examined here, the method could be applied to other types of monochromatic imagery that contains multiplicative noise. {\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007.},

abstract = {A method for classifying objects in sonar imagery is proposed. Motivated by the high-resolution achievable by modern imaging sonars, a novel template matching technique is developed that compares a target signature generated from a simple acoustic model with the actual image of an object being classified. The approach uses both the correlation with target echoes as well as projected acoustic shadow, and is tested on data obtained from a synthetic aperture sonar during experiments at sea. It is compared to two commonly used methods that are based on normalized cross-correlation, and results show that the proposed method outperforms the standard methods in terms of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as confusion matrices. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},
