The world is highly dynamic, constantly changing from moment to moment. An autonomous device aspiring to navigate it must be situationally perceptive and reactive. This requires numerous sensors gathering high quality data at high throughput, adaptive signal processing algorithms and powerful parallel hardware capable of near-realtime responses.

This thesis explores ways to accelerate adaptive acoustic image reconstruction and synthesis. The reconstruction process relies heavily on beamforming: the art of delaying and weighting sensor arrays to achieve desired spatial responses. A beamformer can be viewed as a spatial filter or model, and works best---as any model---when it is neither too simple nor too complex. 

All models have a sweet spot in complexity, a balance point where its estimates offer an ideal compromise between bias and variance. 

Such a spatial filter, or model, . model complexity should be just right. not too simple, not too complex. bias vs variance.

Cognition is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience and the senses. 

The intelligence and autonomy of acoustical imaging devices require more sensory data, algorithmic adaptivity and processing power. All are vital and equally important.
