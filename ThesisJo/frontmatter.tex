This thesis has been submitted to the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Oslo in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree \emph{Philosophiae Doctor} (Ph.D.). This work was carried out at the Digital Signal Processing and Image Analysis group at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, under the supervision of Professor Andreas Austeng and Professor Sverre Holm. The work was financed by the University of Oslo.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

This journey seems to have started a different life ago. Along the way more appreciation has piled up in the depths of my heart than I believed possible. I can only hope to give a little back by extending my sincerest gratitude to the following:


\emph{Professor Andreas Austeng}, for offering great advice, insights, ever-presence, persistence and unwaivering optimism---simply being the best supervisor imaginable;

\emph{Jon Petter Åsen}, for being a wonderful and joyful office mate, colleague, coauthor and friend during the first years;

\emph{Cherie}, my dear faraway friend, for the steady stream of encouraging thoughts, patience and help---asking nothing in return;

\emph{The Department of Informatics, IFE}, for initially granting me this opportunity and later extending it;

\emph{The Norwegian Defence Research Institute, FFI}, for providing data to study and being an amazing workplace;

\emph{Professor Roy Hansen} (FFI/IFE), for initially sparking my interest for sonars and this PhD;

\emph{Professor Sverre Holm} (FFI/IFE), for being my second supervisor, an inspiration, a bottomless pit of knowledge and an aid while I lectured signal processing;

\emph{Stig Synnes} (FFI/IFE), for getting me into volleyball and the mutual friendly nudges to finish writing;

\emph{Kenneth Gade} (FFI), for volleyball enthusiasm and the inspiration and help developing the notation in paper IV,

\emph{Carl-Inge C. Nielsen} (IFE), for the time, knowledge and flying start you offered when this all began;

\emph{Herman Midelfart (FFI)}, for getting a chance to work with you before your days were numbered;

\emph{other colleagues and students} at IFE and FFI, for making work and life enjoyable, every day;

\emph{Friskvernklinikken}, Asker, for showing me a path where I thought there were none;

\emph{Marthe Arnesen}, for the gesture you once made yourself, for what is and for what may come;

\emph{My family}, for all your support, love and presence---through good and bad;

\emph{Myself}, I could not have done it without you ;)

\emph{Joakim}, for giving me purpose, perspective and joy. This is for you.
