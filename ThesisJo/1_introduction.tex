%Preface?
%
%
%Perhaps the most advanced trait of human intelligence is the ability of ask why. We are masters at both understanding what a problem is, as well as finding solutions to it. 
%
%What if we could create intelligent machines? 
%
%When we face a problem we do not understand, To understand what the problem is
%
%This thesis will eventially narrow down to adaptive processing sonar images, and technicalities of the implementation process.



%One of the greatest visions in science is that of artificial intelligence. If we could make machines not only do what we say, but also able to adapt their behavior to handle the unexpected, the possibilities are perhaps only limited by our imagination.
%
%One of mankind's greatest dreams is that of creating intelligent machines. Imagine things you can strike a conversation with, that aides us in our daily lives, that never grow old, impatient or boring. Yesterday science fiction, tomorrow reality. It is not a question whether the intelligent machines are coming, but when and how. Around the corner are self driving cars, virtual reality, ...
%
%To understand how we can evolve the intelligence of machines, perhaps it is best to look at how nature has done it. Our 5 basic senses are sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch. The information here is converted from the respective physical phenomena to electrical impulses through various cells. Then these electrical signals travel to a vast network of neurons that make up our brain. Since each neuron is linked to several others, the data dependency is many to many and very hard to understand.
%
%
%Intelligence is by its essence a feedback loop. 
%This requires them to sense their surroundings and To do so, we need equip it with sensors we grant them sensory input by converting energy in various physical forms into electrical signals, process these using analog and digital electronics, and imbue them with  Most of the components for doing so 
%
%Two big topics in recent years are big data and articifical intelligence. 
%
%
%
%
%The best processing unit we know of is the human mind. Its several billion neurons process information at a staggering rate, and concurrently. As described by this year's nobel price winners, memories of visual objects gets stored in a similar spacial structure in the brain.  
%
%Similar to how the process visual input from our eyes and turn them into the images we perceive, we want turn echo from sonar systems into images of the physical objects the sound was scattered by. 
%
%Want to compare acoustic array to the eyes. Similar, this images from sound should be possible. Brain parallel, and superior. Thus, processing power must be essential to the continued improvement of current sonar systems. But *how* should be additional processing power be used?
%
%One way to improve the performance of imaging devices is to make them more intelligent. 
%To improve the performance of modern imaging devices is becoming increasingly intelligent, they adapt their behaviour to best fit the situation they are in. A regular compact camera for instance, adjusts its shutter opening and speed to 
%
%The image quality of any imaging device is mostly its by its hardware components, and .
%
%There is no best algorithm/system for all tasks. Best would be to use them all as they complement each other. 
%
%Hard to determine the most vital information in an image. The better the image the more information is contains, and the more processing power and memory bandwidth is needed to handle it.

%Preface
%  Way too complex a topic to be covered in fully detail. Perhaps impossible?
%  Interesting enough to be covered, even if just partially.
%  Complexity issue - picture from essay.
%     - We observe the world from one location. The internet lets machine see everything.
%     - Mental constraint. Can machines break through it?

%   Machine intelligence / adaptivity / Deep learning
%      Means for intelligence?
%      Adapts to data
%      Proven powerful
%      Hard to understand, hard to control
%      Data hungry
%      Fascinating perspectives:
%      - Local dependencies work on e.g. images. Due to lack of data?
%      - First layer similar to template matching (convolitional network)
%      - If we can't understand it, perhaps we can parent it? Society's norms a giant assemble of prior knowledge.
%      - Deep neural nets interconnected, learning from each other?
%      - The brain adapts its wiring to solve tasks, does this carry over?
%      - Neuman networks - recursive
%      - Energy efficient. But the body does it MUCH better
%      - Only make the choices that are relevant. Adaptivity vs. computational/data requirements
%        - The body has a lot of information stored in the genome. It doesn't start from scratch
%      - On images - convolutional networks
%        - Layers offer image feature representation of different scales (intuition: create extrinsic shift invariance)
%   Big data
%      Fundament of intelligence?
%      Amount of data recorded and stored immense. Sensors everywhere.
%      Phones, internet searches, smart watches, cars, surveillance cams,   
%   High performance computing
%      Engine of intelligence?
%      Combining deep learning with big data
%      Improving at a rapid pace
%      Quantum computers seem very adapt at deep learning, with node-like structure
%      FPGA might fill a gap too. Hardware generated adaptively. Efficient information exchange often more effective than processing power. Current architectures limited by bandwidth for most applications.

%Signal processing is the art of combining physics, mathematics and computational engineering 
%
%Wonders happen every day. What our senses reveal our brain make real. This is the beauty of signal processing.
%
%- The wonder of how the brain process images. Great information carrier.
%
%\gls{ASIC}
%
%Electromagnetic radiation - poor range due to attenuation and scattering. Use sound instead. Inferior information carrier. Lower frequency and propagation speed.
%
%Sonar. 
%
%- Animals use sound both for imaging and communication underwater.
%
%- Quality. Depends on e.g. sonar frequency, pulse length and directivity. Range resolution given (possibly pulse compressed) signal pulse width. Less data in along-track. resolution given on matched filtered pulse 
%
%- Low PRF - long range. High PRF - short range, high along-track resolution. Propagation time large compared to  SAS, low PRF long antenna. Both long range and high along-track resolution.
%
%- Can use models for sidescan. Main difference improved along-track resolution. Existing models accurate under certain assumptions, but can not be used directly to form side-looking image. Model should include physical processes such as acoustic propagation, seabed reverberation and transducer characteristics.
%
%SAS: Range and frequency independent resolution.
%
%
%Performance:
%- AUV revisit. Better image quality, lower data collection price.
