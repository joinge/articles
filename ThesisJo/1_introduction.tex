% PURPOSE:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Attention: 
% \end{itemize}

% Adaptive methods for image reconstruction and synthesis often 
% Research into HPC, big data and Value added to society when a method 

%Cognitive machines crowning hallmark of human ingenuity. Reactive and proactive. General problem solvers that can aid mankind in its future endeavors. 
%
%Two dominating buzz words are echoing the landscape of modern data science. One is \emph{Deep Learning}, a field that strives to make machines learn the way the brain does. The other is \emph{Big Data}, on the other hand, refers to the fact that we continuously produce, process and store an ever increasing amount of data.

      Processing: Throughput / latency
      Storage:    Raw data or model
      Feedback:   Immediate action/ direct causality / real-time adaptivity / short loop
      Action:     Autonomy
      Examples:   Mapping of genes, Self-driving cars, 2000 Titanics of data
      
   Information: Big data. Quality is key.
   Algorithms: "Intelligent". *Adaptive*. Dynamic. Learning (feedback).
   Processing: Faster. Smaller. Low-power. Dynamic optimization. 
   Feedback: Cost associated with delayed action. 
   Speed: Data compression/significance, Data-/task parallelity, hardware compatibility  
   Future: Discover what we can't? Do what we won't?
   
Image quality

%Preface?
%
%
%Perhaps the most advanced trait of human intelligence is the ability of ask why. We are masters at both understanding what a problem is, as well as finding solutions to it. 
%
%What if we could create intelligent machines? 
%
%When we face a problem we do not understand, To understand what the problem is
%
%This thesis will eventially narrow down to adaptive processing sonar images, and technicalities of the implementation process.



%One of the greatest visions in science is that of artificial intelligence. If we could make machines not only do what we say, but also able to adapt their behavior to handle the unexpected, the possibilities are perhaps only limited by our imagination.
%
%One of mankind's greatest dreams is that of creating intelligent machines. Imagine things you can strike a conversation with, that aides us in our daily lives, that never grow old, impatient or boring. Yesterday science fiction, tomorrow reality. It is not a question whether the intelligent machines are coming, but when and how. Around the corner are self driving cars, virtual reality, ...
%
%To understand how we can evolve the intelligence of machines, perhaps it is best to look at how nature has done it. Our 5 basic senses are sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch. The information here is converted from the respective physical phenomena to electrical impulses through various cells. Then these electrical signals travel to a vast network of neurons that make up our brain. Since each neuron is linked to several others, the data dependency is many to many and very hard to understand.
%
%
%This requires them to sense their surroundings and To do so, we need equip it with sensors we grant them sensory input by converting energy in various physical forms into electrical signals, process these using analog and digital electronics, and imbue them with  Most of the components for doing so 
%
%Two big topics in recent years are big data and articifical intelligence. 
%
%
%
%
%The best processing unit we know of is the human mind. Its several billion neurons process information at a staggering rate, and concurrently. As described by this year's nobel price winners, memories of visual objects gets stored in a similar spacial structure in the brain.  
%
%Similar to how the process visual input from our eyes and turn them into the images we perceive, we want turn echo from sonar systems into images of the physical objects the sound was scattered by. 
%
%Want to compare acoustic array to the eyes. Similar, this images from sound should be possible. Brain parallel, and superior. Thus, processing power must be essential to the continued improvement of current sonar systems. But *how* should be additional processing power be used?
%
%One way to improve the performance of imaging devices is to make them more intelligent. 
%To improve the performance of modern imaging devices is becoming increasingly intelligent, they adapt their behaviour to best fit the situation they are in. A regular compact camera for instance, adjusts its shutter opening and speed to 
%
%The image quality of any imaging device is mostly its by its hardware components, and .
%
%There is no best algorithm/system for all tasks. Best would be to use them all as they complement each other. 
%
%Hard to determine the most vital information in an image. The better the image the more information is contains, and the more processing power and memory bandwidth is needed to handle it.

%      Data hungry
%      Fascinating perspectives:
%      - Local dependencies work on e.g. images. Due to lack of data?
%      - First layer similar to template matching (convolitional network)
%      - If we can't understand it, perhaps we can parent it? Society's norms a giant assemble of prior knowledge.
%      - Deep neural nets interconnected, learning from each other?
%      - The brain adapts its wiring to solve tasks, does this carry over?
%      - Neuman networks - recursive
%      - Brain focused vs. diffused state, chunk nurturing vs. forming
%      - Energy efficient. But the body does it MUCH better
%      - Only make the choices that are relevant. Adaptivity vs. computational/data requirements
%        - The body has a lot of information stored in the genome. It doesn't start from scratch
%      - On images - convolutional networks
%        - Layers offer image feature representation of different scales (intuition: create extrinsic shift invariance)
