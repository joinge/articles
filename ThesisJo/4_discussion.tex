\chapter{Discussion and Outlook}

The main contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows:

\textbf{Paper I} - \textit{Time-domain MVDR beamforming on GPUs in active sonar imaging}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Accelerates the MVDR beamformer through algorithmic reductions and fine-tuning to a GPU, yielding a real-time solution.
\item Demonstrates speeds exceeding 1\,Mpixel/s on systems with no more than 32 channels, two orders of magnitude faster than a semi-optimized C-implementation on a CPU.
\item Offers rarely documented insights into hardware limitations, design implications and computational efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

Time-domain MVDR is the reference method for creating sonar images using the minimum variance criterion. It computes array weights analytically, yielding optimal weights in the minimum variance sense. Initially, this may seem ideal, but its use is cumbersome: parameters for temporal averaging, spatial averaging and regularization must often be fine-tuned ad-hoc to obtain improved image quality. GPU acceleration mitigates the high computational complexity resulting from estimating and inverting a spatial covariance matrix, yielding real-time performance.


\textbf{Paper II} - \textit{Frequency-domain MVDR beamforming on GPUs in clinical ultrasound imaging}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Alters the implementation in Paper I to operate in beamspace (frequency domain), reduced to its three center beams (the most significant ones).
\item Demonstrates speeds exceeding 1\,Mpixel/s on systems with 64 and 96 channels.
\item Yields similar image quality to time-domain MVDR, in accordance with former studies in active sonar.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Paper III} - \textit{LCA beamforming versus MVDR in active sonar imaging}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shows that LCA beamformer performs similarly to MVDR with only 6 weight sets to choose from: The rectangular and Kaiser function with $\beta=6$, steered to $\phi\in[0,\pm\frac{1}{2}\delta{\phi_{-3dB}}]$, where $\delta{\phi_{-3dB}}$ is the $-3$\,dB bandwidth of the amplitude response to the weight set.
%Contrasts the LCA and MVDR beamformer, two different ways to solve the minimum variance criterion. The former selects the best performing weights from a predefined set, the latter computes them from a sample covariance matrix estimated from the input data.
\item Finds no further improvement above 15 suitable weight sets.
\item Provides insights into typical amplitude responses of MVDR constrained for active sonar imaging and pinpoints their resemblance to the chosen LCA weight sets. 
\item Suggests swapping the Kaiser function trigonometric one parametrized by $\alpha$, yielding similar image quality while allowing an analytic solution for $\alpha$ to be found. This reduces the algorithm to simply iterating through steering angles.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Paper IV} - \textit{Real-time sonar image synthesis on GPUs for automatic target recognition}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implements a SAS simulator on GPU that allows AUVs to compare its images on-the-fly to vast numbers of objects and configurations, yielding superior classification results and real-time responses.
\item Extends a navigational notation system with topological ideas from robotics and homogeneous coordinates, promoting geometrical clarity and validity while aiding the designer to focus on higher level concepts, such as manipulating rigid objects.
\item Demonstrates superior classification accuracy on experimental data of a few thousand objects from Jesus Bay, Norway, at false positive rates (FRP) below 20, similar %, and tied with it above. 
\end{enumerate}

% We grant them perception by performing automatic target recognition (ATR) with an
% acoustic simulator for synthetic aperture sonar (SAS). With it, an AUV can compare
% its images on-the-fly to vast numbers of objects and configurations, yielding superior
% classification results and real-time responses. This is validated on experimental data of
% a few thousand objects from Jesus Bay, Norway, recorded by the Kongsberg Maritime
% HISAS1030 sonar. Our simulator consistently outperformed a conventional method using
% predefined images at false positive rates (FRP) below 20 %, and tied with it above.

\section{Onlook}


Machine intelligence requires high fidelity sensory data, sophisticated adaptive signal processing and massive computing power. If history is any indication, the future promises more of everything in these categories.

The future holds a promise of more of everything: more sensors (data), more signal processing and more processing power.

\emph{Big data} and \emph{Internet of things} (IoT) and \emph{big data} will continue to empower us with ever more information.  


\emph{Machine learning} has made leaps with the combination of deep neural networks and big data.

\emph{System on Chips} (Soc) are becoming increasingly popular as a heterogeneous computing platform.

It targets the need for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) can easily replace most analog front-end electronics in a sonar or ultrasound system with a software-defined solution, yielding better flexibility, reduced design complexity, improved bandwidth and lowered latency, all in a tiny physical footprint. Although the GPU
