 
Dear Editor / Associate Editor

Please find enclosed (in single column both a greyscale and color edition) our manuscript "An Optimized GPU Implementation of the MVDR Beamformer for Active Sonar Imaging" by Buskenes et al., which we would like to submit for publication as a peer-reviewed Journal Article in IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering (IEEE-JOE).

To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper describing a GPU implementation of such an adaptive algorithm applied to active sonar imaging. We describe how it enables adaptive image reconstruction at very high rates, while discussing the GPUs potential, limitations and feasibility in the mentioned context. We believe this topic would appeal to readers concerned with image reconstruction, and that readers looking into GPUs for accelerating their algorithms may find that we provide some interesting insights on the matter that is often overlooked.

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. Also, all authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to the IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering (IEEE-JOE).

We look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Best Regards
Jo Inge Buskenes et al.
