  abstract = {We have applied the minimum variance (MV) adaptive beamformer to medical
	ultrasound imaging and shown significant improvement in image quality
	compared to delay-and-sum (DAS). We demonstrate reduced main-lobe
	width and suppression of sidelobes on both simulated and experimental
	RF data of closely spaced wire targets, which gives potential contrast
	and resolution enhancement in medical images. The method is applied
	to experimental RF data from a heart phantom, in which we show increased
	resolution and improved definition of the ventricular walls. A potential
	weakness of adaptive beamformers is sensitivity to errors in the
	assumed wavefield parameters. We look at two ways to increase robustness
	of the proposed method; spatial smoothing and diagonal loading. We
	show that both are controlled by a single parameter that can move
	the performance from that of a MV beamformer to that of a DAS beamformer.
	We evaluate the sensitivity to velocity errors and show that reliable
	amplitude estimates are achieved while the mainlobe width and sidelobe
	levels are still significantly lower than for the conventional beam-former.},

  abstract = {The classical problem of choosing apodization functions for a beamformer
	involves a trade-off between main lobe width and side lobe level,
	i.e., a trade-off between resolution and contrast. To avoid this
	trade-off, the application of adaptive beamforming, such as minimum
	variance beamforming, to medical ultrasound imaging has been suggested.
	This has been an active topic of research in medical ultrasound imaging
	in the recent years, and several authors have demonstrated significant
	improvements in image resolution. However, the improvement comes
	at a considerable cost. Where the complexity of a conventional beamformer
	is linear with the number of elements [O(M)], the complexity of a
	minimum variance beamformer is as high as O(M3). In this paper, we
	have applied a method based on an idea by Vignon and Burcher which
	is data-adaptive, but selects the apodization function between several
	predefined windows, giving linear complexity. In the proposed method,
	we select an apodization function for each depth along a scan line
	based on the optimality criterion of the minimum variance beamformer.
	However, unlike the minimum variance beamformer, which has an infinite
	solution space, we limit the number of possible outcomes to a set
	of predefined windows. The complexity of the method is then only
	P times that of the conventional method, where P is the number of
	predefined windows. The suggested method gives significant improvement
	in image resolution at a low cost. The method is robust, can handle
	coherent targets, and is easy to implement. It may also be used as
	a classifier because the selected window gives information about
	the object being imaged. We have applied the method to simulated
	data of wire targets and a cyst phantom, and to experimental RF data
	from a heart phantom using P = 4 and P = 12. The results show significant
	improvement in image resolution compared with delay-and-sum.},
