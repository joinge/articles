abstract = {A program for the simulation of ultrasound systems is presented. It is based on the Tupholme-Stepanishen method, and is fast because of the use of a far-field approximation. Any kind of transducer geometry and excitation can be simulated, and both pulse-echo and continuous wave fields can be calculated for both transmit and pulse-echo.},
