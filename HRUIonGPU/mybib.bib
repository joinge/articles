abstract = {The problem of locating point-like targets beyond the classical resolution limit is revisited. Although time-reversal MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) is known for its super-resolution ability in localization of point scatterers, in the presence of noise this super-resolution property will easily break down. In this paper a phase-coherent version of time-reversal MUSIC is proposed, which can overcome this fundamental limit. The algorithm has been tested employing synthetic multiple scattering data based on the Foldy-Lax model, as well as experimental ultrasound data acquired in a water tank. Using a limited frequency band, it was demonstrated that the phase-coherent MUSIC algorithm has the potential of giving significantly better resolved scatterer locations than standard time-reversal MUSIC.},

abstract = {In adaptive ultrasound imaging, accurate estimation of the array covariance matrix is of great importance, and biases the performance of the adaptive beamformer. The more accurately the covariance matrix can be estimated, the better the resolution and contrast can be achieved in the ultrasound image. To this end, in this paper, we have used the forward-backward spatial averaging for array covariance matrix estimation, which is then employed in minimum variance (MV) weights calculation. The performance of the proposed forward-backward MV (FBMV) beamformer is tested on simulated data obtained using Field II. Data for two closely located point targets surrounded by speckle pattern are simulated showing the higher amplitude resolution of the FBMV beamformer in comparison to the forward-only (F-only) MV beamformers, without the need for diagonal loading. A circular cyst with a diameter of 6 mm and a phantom containing wire targets and two cysts with different diameters of 8 mm and 6 mm are also simulated. The simulations show that the FBMV beamformer, in contrast to the F-only MV, could estimate the background speckle statistics without the need for temporal smoothing, resulting in higher contrast for the FBMV-resulted image in comparison to the MV images. In addition, the effect of steering vector errors is investigated by applying an error of the sound speed estimate to the ultrasound data. The simulations show that the proposed FBMV beamformer presents a satisfactory robustness against data misalignment resulted from steering vector errors, outperforming the regularized F-only MV beamformer. These improvements are achieved without compromising the good resolution of the MV beamformer and resulted from more accurate estimation of the covariance matrix and consequently, the more accurate setting of the MV weights.},

abstract = {Currently, the nonadaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer is used in medical ultrasound imaging. However, due to its data-independent nature, DAS leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. In this paper, an adaptive minimum variance (MV)-based beamformer that combines the MV and coherence factor (CF) weighting is introduced and adapted to medical ultrasound imaging. MV-adaptive beamformers can improve the image quality in terms of resolution and sidelobes by suppressing off-axis signals, while keeping onaxis ones. In addition, CF weighting can improve contrast and sidelobes by emphasizing the in-phase signals and reducing the out-of-phase ones. Combining MV and CF weighting results in simultaneous improvement of imaging resolution and contrast, outperforming both DAS and MV beamformers. In addition, because of the power of CF in reducing the focusing errors, the proposed method presents satisfactory robustness against sound velocity inhomogeneities, outperforming the regularized MV beamformer. The excellent performance of the proposed beamforming approach is demonstrated by several simulated examples.},

abstract = {The output of an array of sansors is considered to be a homogeneous random field. In this case there is a spectral representation for this field, similar to that for stationary random processes, which consists of a superposition of traveling waves. The frequency-wavenumber power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation uses a fixed-wavenumber window and its resolution is determined essentially by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana. In addition, the application of the high-resolution method to other areas, such as radar, sonar, and radio astronomy, is indicated.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic guided wave imaging with a sparse, or spatially distributed, array can detect and localize damage over large areas. Conventional delay-and-sum images from such an array typically have a relatively high noise floor, however, and contain artifacts that often cannot be discriminated from damage. Considered here is minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) imaging, which is a variation of delay-and-sum imaging whereby weighting coefficients are adaptively computed at each pixel location. Utilization of MVDR significantly improves image quality compared with delay-and-sum imaging, and additional improvements are obtained from incorporation of a priori scattering information in the MVDR method, use of phase information, and instantaneous windowing. Simulated data from a through-hole scatterer are used to illustrate performance improvements, and a performance metric is proposed that allows for quantitative comparisons of images from a known scatterer. Experimental results from a through-hole scatterer are also provided that illustrate imaging efficacy.},

Due to near-field properties, the energy of the ultrasound data reduces towards the edges of the transducer. The influence of this near-field effect is demonstrated, and a method to reduce this influence is proposed. By reducing the number of active sensor elements, an increased resolution can be obtained with the MV beamformer. This observation is directly opposite the well-known relation between the spatial extent of the aperture and the achievable resolution. The investigations are based on Field II simulated data using a 128-element transducer with a large spatial extent. The results show that an increased resolution can be obtained, when using only the central part of the transducer compared to using the entire spatial extent. Using the central 32 or 48 elements provides an increased resolution compared to using all 128 elements.},

However, whenever the knowledge of the SOI steering vector is imprecise (as is often the case in practice), the performance of the Capon beamformer may become worse than that of the standard beamformer. Diagonal loading (including its extended versions) has been a popular approach to improve the robustness of the Capon beamformer. We show that a natural extension of the Capon beamformer to the case of uncertain steering vectors also belongs to the class of diagonal loading approaches, but the amount of diagonal loading can be precisely calculated based on the uncertainty set of the steering vector. The proposed robust Capon beamformer can be efficiently computed at a comparable cost with that of the standard Capon beamformer. Its excellent performance for SOI power estimation is demonstrated via a number of numerical examples.},

A review of the area of array processing is given. The focus is on parameter estimation methods, and many relevant problems are only briefly mentioned. We emphasize the relatively more recent subspace-based methods in relation to beamforming. The article consists of background material and of the basic problem formulation. Then we introduce spectral-based algorithmic solutions to the signal parameter estimation problem. We contrast these suboptimal solutions to parametric methods. Techniques derived from maximum likelihood principles as well as geometric arguments are covered. Later, a number of more specialized research topics are briefly reviewed. Then, we look at a number of real-world problems for which sensor array processing methods have been applied. We also include an example with real experimental data involving closely spaced emitters and highly correlated signals, as well as a manufacturing application example},

abstract = {Minimum variance beamforming has been recently attended in medical ultrasound imaging. In spite of its capabilities in suppressing interferences resulting in an enhanced resolution, its computational complexity is a serious restriction for its implementing. In this paper, we study the outcomes of applying a class of parametric windows, in which the parameters are adaptively determined. Furthermore, we develop a new parametric window with improved resolution. The method employs a single realization full array data to estimate the interfering signals, based on which, the parameters of a parametric window are calculated in a way to minimize the squared value of the output. The structure of the window along with the additional L2 norm constraint, guarantee the desired signal i.e. the signal received from on-axis, is passed without degradation, while minimizing the interferences. The most important advantage of the method presented here is the complexity proportional to the number of array elements, which is like a delay and sum beamformer, as well as outperforming it in resolution and contrast. The method also indicates better contrast than minimum variance beamformer.},

This paper describes a new approach, the constrained adaptive beamformer (CAB), which builds on classic array processing methods from radar and sonar. Given a desired frequency response for the mainlobe beam, the CAB reduces off-axis signals by imposing an optimal set of weights on the receive aperture. A linearly constrained adaptive filter dynamically adjusts the aperture weights in response to the incoming data. Initial results show a factor of two improvement in point target resolution and a 60\% contrast improvement for low echogenicity cysts. The CAB could considerably improve cardiac and abdominal image quality. We address implementation issues and discuss future work.},

@article{MohammadzadehAsl2010,
abstract = {Recently, adaptive beamforming methods have been successfully applied to medical ultrasound imaging, resulting in significant improvement in image quality compared with non-adaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformers. Most of the adaptive beamformers presented in the ultrasound imaging literature are based on the minimum variance (MV) beamformer which can significantly improve the imaging resolution, although their success in enhancing the contrast has not yet been satisfactory. It is desirable for the beamformer to improve the resolution and contrast at the same time. To this end, in this paper, we have applied the eigenspace-based MV (EIBMV) beamformer to medical ultrasound imaging and have shown a simultaneous improvement in imaging resolution and contrast. EIBMV beamformer utilizes the eigenstructure of the covariance matrix to enhance the performance of the MV beamformer. The weight vector of the EIBMV is found by projecting the MV weight vector onto a vector subspace constructed from the eigenstructure of the covariance matrix. Using EIBMV weights instead of the MV ones leads to reduced sidelobes and improved contrast, without compromising the high resolution of the MV beamformer. In addition, the proposed EIBMV beamformer presents a satisfactory robustness against data misalignment resulting from steering vector errors, outperforming the regularized MV beamformer.},

abstract = {Applying the Capon adaptive beamformer in medical ultrasound imaging results in enhanced resolution by improving the interference-suppressing capabilities of the array. This improvement comes at the expense of an increased computational complexity. We have investigated the application of a beamspace adaptive beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging, which can be used to achieve reduced computational complexity with performance comparable to that of the Capon beamformer. The idea behind beamspace beamforming is that, instead of using the spatial statistics of the elements in the array to differentiate between signals and interference, we use the spatial statistics of a set of orthogonal beams, which are formed in different directions. This represents a shift from element space to beamspace. Because the majority of interference in medical ultrasound imaging is constrained to a limited spatial interval due to the focused transmit beam, this latter space can be reduced to a dimension that is lower than that of element space. We show, using simulations and experimental data, that this dimension can be selected as low as 3 while still achieving performance comparable to its element space counterpart.},

abstract = {The classical problem of choosing apodization functions for a beamformer involves a trade-off between main lobe width and side lobe level, i.e., a trade-off between resolution and contrast. To avoid this trade-off, the application of adaptive beamforming, such as minimum variance beamforming, to medical ultrasound imaging has been suggested. This has been an active topic of research in medical ultrasound imaging in the recent years, and several authors have demonstrated significant improvements in image resolution. However, the improvement comes at a considerable cost. Where the complexity of a conventional beamformer is linear with the number of elements [O(M)], the complexity of a minimum variance beamformer is as high as O(M³). In this paper, we have applied a method based on an idea by Vignon and Burcher which is data-adaptive, but selects the apodization function between several predefined windows, giving linear complexity. In the proposed method, we select an apodization function for each depth along a scan line based on the optimality criterion of the minimum variance beamformer. However, unlike the minimum variance beamformer, which has an infinite solution space, we limit the number of possible outcomes to a set of predefined windows. The complexity of the method is then only P times that of the conventional method, where P is the number of predefined windows. The suggested method gives significant improvement in image resolution at a low cost. The method is robust, can handle coherent targets, and is easy to implement. It may also be used as a classifier because the selected window gives information about the object being imaged. We have applied the method to simulated data of wire targets and a cyst phantom, and to experimental RF data from a heart phantom using P = 4 and P = 12. The results show significant improvement in image resolution compared with delay-and-sum.},

In this paper, we have used the minimum-variance beamformer to show how the low sidelobe levels and narrow beamwidth of adaptive methods can be used, not only to increase resolution, but also to enhance imaging in several ways. By using a minimum-variance beamformer instead of delay-and-sum on reception, reduced aperture, higher frame rates, or increased depth of penetration can be achieved without sacrificing image quality. We demonstrate comparable resolution on images of wire targets and a cyst phantom obtained with a 96-element, 18.5-mm transducer using delay-and-sum, and a 48-element, 9.25-mm transducer using minimum variance. To increase frame rate, fewer and wider transmit beams in combination with several parallel receive beams may be used. We show comparable resolution to delay-and-sum using minimum variance, 1/4th of the number of transmit beams and 4 parallel receive beams, potentially increasing the frame rate by 4. Finally, we show that by lowering the frequency of the transmitted beam and beamforming the received data with the minimum variance beamformer, increased depth of penetration is achieved without sacrificing lateral resolution.},

abstract = {Medical ultrasound imaging is conventionally done by insonifying the imaged medium with focused beams. The backscattered echoes are beamformed using delay-and-sum operations that cannot completely eliminate the contribution of signals backscattered by structures off the imaging beam to the beamsum. It leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. This paper presents an adaptation of the Capon beamformer algorithm to ultrasound medical imaging with focused beams. The strategy is to apply data-dependent weight functions to the imaging aperture. These weights act as lateral spatial filters that filter out off-axis signals. The weights are computed for each point in the imaged medium, from the statistical analysis of the signals backscattered by that point to the different elements of the imaging probe when insonifying it with different focused beams. Phantom and in vivo images are presented to illustrate the benefits of the Capon algorithm over the conventional delay and-sum approach. On heart sector images, the clutter in the heart chambers is decreased. The endocardium border is better defined. On abdominal linear array images, significant contrast and resolution enhancement are observed.},

abstract = {Some success has been demonstrated in the extensive studies of adaptive imaging, but these approaches are generally not suitable for high-frame-rate (HFR) imaging where broad transmit beams are required. In this study, we propose an effective adaptive imaging method suitable for HFR imaging based on coherence-factor (CF) weighting and the minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) method. The CF is an index of focusing quality estimated from receive-channel data in which the amplitude of each image pixel is weighted by the corresponding CF so as to reduce the unwanted sidelobes. Direct implementation of CF weighting in HFR imaging does not provide satisfactory results because the broad transmit beams required for HFR imaging reduce the accuracy of CF calculations. In this study, we alleviated this problem by applying the MVDR method. We test the proposed method with the synthetic transmit aperture method where only 8 firings are required to form an image. Both simulations and clinical breast imaging data were used, and the proposed method enhanced the mean contrast by around 4.6 dB and the mean contrast-to-noise ratio by around 20\%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective at improving the image quality.},

abstract = {Currently, the nonadaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer is extensively used for ultrasound imaging, despite the fact that it has lower resolution and worse interference suppression capability than the adaptive standard Capon beamformer (SCB) if the steering vector corresponding to the signal of interest (SOI) is accurately known. The main problem which restricts the use of SCB, however, is that SCB lacks robustness against steering vector errors that are inevitable in practice. Whenever this happens, the performance of SCB may hecome worse than that of DAS. Therefore, a robust adaptive beamformer is desirable to maintain the robustness of DAS and adaptivity of SCB. In this paper we consider a recent promising robust Capon beamformer (RCB) for ultrasound imaging. We propose two ways of implementing RCB, one based on time delay and the other based on time reversal. RCB extends SCB by allowing the array steering vector to be within an uncertainty set. Hence, it restores the appeal of SCB including its high resolution and superb interference suppression capabilities, and also retains the attractiveness of DAS including its robustness against steering vector errors. The time-delay-based RCB can tolerate the misalignment of data samples and the time-reversal-based RCB can withstand the uncertainty of the Green's function. Both time-delay-based RCB and time-reversal-based RCB can be efficiently computed at a comparable cost to SCB. The excellent performances of the proposed robust adaptive beamforming approaches are demonstrated via a number of simulated and experimental examples.},

abstract = {Although they show potential to improve ultrasound image quality, plane wave (PW) compounding and synthetic aperture (SA) imaging are computationally demanding and are known to be challenging to implement in real-time. In this work, we have developed a novel beamformer architecture with the real-time parallel processing capacity needed to enable fast realization of PW compounding and SA imaging. The beamformer hardware comprises an array of graphics processing units (GPUs) that are hosted within the same computer workstation. Their parallel computational resources are controlled by a pixel-based software processor that includes the operations of analytic signal conversion, delay-and-sum beamforming, and recursive compounding as required to generate images from the channel-domain data samples acquired using PW compounding and SA imaging principles. When using two GTX-480 GPUs for beamforming and one GTX-470 GPU for recursive compounding, the beamformer can compute compounded 512 x 255 pixel PW and SA images at throughputs of over 4700 fps and 3000 fps, respectively, for imaging depths of 5 cm and 15 cm (32 receive channels, 40 MHz sampling rate). Its processing capacity can be further increased if additional GPUs or more advanced models of GPU are used.},
