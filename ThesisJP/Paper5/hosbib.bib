abstract = {Analytical two-dimensional (2D) integral expressions are derived for fast calculations of time-harmonic and transient near-field pressures generated by apodized rectangular pistons. These 2D expressions represent an extension of the fast near-field method (FNM) for uniformly excited pistons. After subdividing the rectangular piston into smaller rectangles, the pressure produced by each of the smaller rectangles is calculated using the uniformly excited FNM expression for a rectangular piston, and the total pressure generated by an apodized rectangular piston is the superposition of the pressures produced by all of the subdivided rectangles. By exchanging summation variables and performing integration by parts, a 2D apodized FNM expression is obtained, and the resulting expression eliminates the numerical singularities that are otherwise present in numerical models of pressure fields generated by apodized rectangular pistons. A simplified time space decomposition method is also described, and this method further reduces the computation time for transient pressure fields. The results are compared with the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral and the FIELD II program for a rectangular source with each side equal to four wavelengths. For time-harmonic calculations with a 0.1 normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), the apodized FNM is 4.14 times faster than the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral and 59.43 times faster than the FIELD II program, and for a 0.01 NRMSE, the apodized FNM is 12.50 times faster than the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral and 155.06 times faster than the FIELD II program. For transient calculations with a 0.1 NRMSE, the apodized FNM is 2.31 times faster than the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral and 4.66 times faster than the FIELD II program, and for a 0.01 NRMSE, the apodized FNM is 11.90 times faster than the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral and 24.04 times faster than the FIELD II program. Thus, the 2D apodized FNM is ideal for fast pressure calculations and for accurate reference calculations in the near-field region.},

abstract = {A fast method for computing the acoustic field of ultrasound transducers is presented with application to rectangular elements that are cylindrically focused. No closed-form solutions exist for this case but several numerical techniques have been described in the ultrasound imaging literature. Our motivation is the rapid calculation of imaging kernels for physics-based diagnostic imaging for which current methods are too computationally intensive. Here, the surface integral defining the acoustic field from a baffled piston is converted to a 3-D spatial convolution of the element surface and the Green's function. A 3-D version of the overlap-save method from digital signal processing is employed to obtain a fast computational algorithm based on spatial Fourier transforms. Further efficiency is gained by using a separable approximation to the Green's function through singular value decomposition and increasing the effective sampling rate by polyphase filtering. The tradeoff between accuracy and spatial sampling rate is explored to determine appropriate parameters for a specific transducer. Comparisons with standard tools such as Field II are presented, where nearly 2 orders of magnitude improvement in computation speed is observed for similar accuracy.},

abstract = {Most available ultrasound imaging simulation methods are based on the spatial impulse response approach. The execution speed of such a simulation is of the order of days for one heart-sized frame using desktop computers. For some applications, the accuracy of such rigorous simulation approaches is not necessary. This work outlines a much faster 3-D ultrasound imaging simulation approach that can be applied to tasks like simulating 3-D ultrasound images for speckletracking. The increased speed of the proposed simulation method is based primarily on the approximation that the point spread function is set to be spatially invariant, which is a reasonably good approximation when using polar coordinates for simulating images from phased arrays with constant aperture. Ultrasound images are found as the convolution of the PSF and an object of sparsely distributed scatterers. The scatterers are passed through an anti-aliasing filter before insertion into a regular beam-space grid to reduce the bandwidth and significantly reduce the amount of data. A comparison with the well-established simulation software package Field II has been made. A simulation of a cyst image using the same input object was found to be in the order of 7000 times slower than the presented method. Following these considerations, the proposed simulation method can be a rapid and valuable tool for working with 3-D ultrasound imaging and in particular 3-D speckle-tracking.},

abstract = {Data simulation is an important research tool to evaluate algorithms. Two types of methods are currently used to simulate medical ultrasound data: those based on acoustic models and those based on convolution models. The simulation of ultrasound data sequences is very time-consuming. In addition, many applications require accounting for the out-of-plane motion induced by the 3-D displacement of scatterers. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model adapted to a fast simulation of ultrasonic data sequences with 3-D moving scatterers. Our approach is based on the convolution model. The scatterers are moved in a 3-D continuous medium between each pair of images and then projected onto the imaging plane before being convolved. This paper discusses the practical implementation of the convolution that can be performed directly or after a grid approximation. The grid approximation convolution is obviously faster than the direct convolution but generates errors resulting from the approximation to the grid's nodes. We provide the analytical expression of these errors and then define 2 intensity-based criteria to quantify them as a function of the spatial sampling. The simulation of an image requires less than 2 s with oversampling, thus reducing these errors. The simulation model is validated with first- and second-order statistics. The positions of the scatterers at each imaging time can be provided by a displacement model. An example applied to flow imaging is proposed. Several cases are used to show that this displacement model provides realistic data. It is validated with speckle tracking, a well-known motion estimator in ultrasound imaging.},

abstract = {A general approach is presented for determining the acoustic fields of rectangularly symmetric, baffled, time-harmonic sources under the Fresnel approximation. This approach is applicable to a variety of separable source configurations, including uniform, exponential, Gaussian, sinusoidal, and error function surface velocity distributions, with and without focusing in either surface dimension. In each case, the radiated field is given by a formula similar to that for a uniform rectangular source, except for additional scaling of wave number and azimuthal distance parameters. The expressions presented are generalized to three different Fresnel approximations that correspond, respectively, to diffracted plane waves, diffracted spherical waves, or diffracted cylindrical waves. Numerical results, for several source geometries relevant to ultrasonic applications, show that these expressions accurately depict the radiated pressure fields, except for points very near the radiating aperture. Highest accuracy near the source is obtained by choice of the Fresnel approximation most suited to the source geometry, while the highest accuracy far from the source is obtained by the approximation corresponding to diffracted spherical waves. The methods are suitable for volumetric computations of acoustic fields including focusing, apodization, and attenuation effects.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing adoption of other imaging modalities, ultrasound guidance is widely used for surgical procedures and clinical imaging due to its low cost, non-invasiveness, and real-time visual feedback. Many ultrasound-guided procedures require extensive training and where possible training on simulations should be preferred over patients. Computational resources for existing approaches to ultrasound simulation are usually limited by real-time requirements. Unlike previous approaches we simulate freehand ultrasound images from CT data on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We build upon the method proposed by Wein et al. for estimating ultrasound reflection properties of tissue and modify it to a computationally more efficient form. In addition to previous approaches, we also estimate ultrasound absorption properties from CT data. Using NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), we provide a physically plausible simulation of ultrasound reflection, shadowing artifacts, speckle noise and radial blurring. The same algorithm can be used for simulating either linear or radial imaging, and all parameters of the simulated probe are interactively configurable at runtime, including ultrasound frequency and intensity as well as field geometry. With current hardware we are able to achieve an image width of up to 1023 pixels from raw CT data in real-time, without any pre-processing and without any loss of information from the CT image other than from interpolation of the input data. Visual comparison to real ultrasound images indicates satisfactory results.},

abstract = {The implementation of the angular spectrum approach based on the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform is evaluated for near-field pressure simulations of square ultrasound transducers, where the three-dimensional pressure field is calculated from the normal velocity distribution on the transducer surface. The pressure field is propagated in the spatial frequency domain with the spatial propagator or the spectral propagator. The spatial propagator yields accurate results in the central portion of the computational grid while significant errors are produced near the edge due to the finite extent of the window applied to the spatial propagator. Likewise, the spectral propagator is inherently undersampled in the spatial frequency domain, and this causes high frequency errors in the computed pressure field. This aliasing problem is alleviated with angular restriction. The results show that, in nonattenuating media, the spatial propagator achieves smaller errors than the spectral propagator after the region of interest is truncated to exclude the windowing error. For pressure calculations in attenuating media or with apodized pistons as sources, the spatial and spectral propagator achieve similar accuracies. In all simulations, the angular spectrum calculations with the spatial propagator take more time than calculations with the spectral propagator.},

abstract = {A method for fast simulation of nonlinear wave propagation has been developed. It is based on quasi-linear approximation. By using the angular spectrum method, the contribution from an arbitrarily plane was found by back propagation of the wave field from the focal plane, squaring the field, and forward propagation of the result to the observation plane. In the spatial/time Fourier-domain, propagation is performed by a complex exponential factor, whereas the square operation corresponds to a 3D convolution. It turned out that the integration along the ultrasound beam could be solved analytically. The computation in the Fourier-domain was then reduced to a triple-integral. The resulting second harmonic wave in the observation plane was found by (3D) inverse FFT. A simulation program has been implemented in Matlab, using a laptop PC with 1.2 GHz Pentium III processor. Applied to a phased array transducer the simulation time was less than 5 minutes. The implementation of the algorithm was verified by measurements. We observed satisfactory accordance between simulations and measurements.},

abstract = {Nonlinear propagation of sound has been exploited in the last 15 years in medical ultrasound imaging through tissue harmonic imaging (THI). THI creates an image by filtering the received ultrasound echo around the second harmonic frequency band. This technique produces images of enhanced quality due to reduced body wall reverberation, lower perturbations from off-axis echoes, and multiple scattering of reduced amplitude. In order to optimize the image quality it is essential to be able to predict the amplitude level and spatial distribution of the propagating ultrasound pulse. A method based on the quasi-linear approximation has been developed to quickly provide an estimate of the ultrasound pulse. This method does not need to propagate the pulse stepwise from the source plane to the desired depth; it directly computes a transverse profile at any depth from the definitions of the transducer and the pulse. The computation handles three spatial dimensions which allows for any transducer geometry. A comparison of pulse forms, transverse profiles, as well as axial profiles obtained by this method and state-of-the-art simulators, the KZKTexas code, and Abersim, shows a satisfactory match. The computation time for the quasi-linear method is also smaller than the time required by the other methods.},
