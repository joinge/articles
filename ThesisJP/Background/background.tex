General introduction to ultrasound, GPUs etc...

\section{General-purpose computing on graphics processing units}

Architecture. See Paper II.

About theoretical FLOPS: Note that these are theoretical numbers and the actual throughput typically is algorithm dependent.

\section {Ultrasound imaging}

Small section about heart anatomy.

Typical probes, scan sequences, resolution and sampling.
							
\subsection{Basic beamforming}

Delay and sum. Apodization. (See intro to Paper II or III).
Time v.s. phase delays.

\subsection{Adaptive Beamforming}\label{sec:adaptbf}

Intro to adaptive beamforming. List other variants (LCA, beamspace, Eigen space etc.). 

Add section about the computationally complexity. How many flops are required per rx-beam etc...
						
\subsection{Shift invariance}

\section{Volume rendering}

Get section from master theses. Ray casting and opacity functions.

\subsection{Adaptive volume rendering}

Visibility driven visualization.

\section{Field Simulations}

Small chapter about different simulation tools (See hos paper).
